            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T might ſeem a ſtrange Speech (had it not had a private interpretation) that of <hi>Tireſtas</hi> the Prophet, quoted by the Poet, who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Liriope,</hi> enquiring of him, Whether her ſon <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſhould be long lived or not? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, He ſhould <hi>if he knew not himſelf;</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as ſtrange as it was obſcure: for that Learned and wiſe <hi>Greek,</hi> held, <hi>That the knowledg of a mans ſelf was the first step to vertue;</hi> and ſad experience witneſſeth that many in our daies have been ruinated for lack of it, but unhappy <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> (if the <hi>Poets</hi> ſay true) fell inammored on his own beauty, and ſo periſhed. If it made any thing at all to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I could quote you what many other Hiſtories ſay of him; however the Moral of it (if rightly conſidered) may give a check to ſuch, who purſuing after ſhadows, loſe the ſubſtance: As for the Speech of <hi>Tireſias,</hi> if it be taken in a general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it will be found as falſe as what is falſeſt, the knowledg of a mans ſelf being of all Natural knowledg the moſt profound and moſt to be deſired, for he that knows himſelf aright cannot but know all the world, becauſe he is an Epitome of it; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was that which <hi>Solomon</hi> deſired when God gave him all the world to chuſe in, and bad him ask what he would have, and he would give it him, as you may reade 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 3. he ſaid, <hi>Lord, give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart that he may judg between good and bad: And the ſpeech pleaſed the Lord that</hi> Solomon <hi>had asked this
<pb facs="tcp:40322:3"/> thing: And God ſaid unto him, becauſe thou haſt asked this thing, and haſt not asked for thy ſelf long life, neither hast asked riches for thy ſelf, neither hast asked the life of thy enemies, but hast asked for thy ſelf Knowledg to diſcern judgment; Behold, I have done according to thy word, Lo, I have given thee a wiſe and understanding heart, ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhall any ariſe like unto thee; And alſo I have given thee that which thou haſt not asked, both riches and honor.</hi> It ſeems God rewards thoſe with tranſitory things which ſeek knowledg of him in the firſt place, and if ſo, how will he reward thoſe that labor what they can with might and main to hide knowledg from their Brethren and fellow Creatures?

            <p>It was a moſt Divine Speech of the <hi>Poet</hi> indeed, Man was made with an erected face to admire at the glory of the Creator; a man ſhall ſeldom hear a truer word in the Pulpit, ſo that it is palpable that man was not made for Pleaſure, nor Honor, nor enough of needful outward things which they commonly call Riches, which the men of this Iron Age look after in the firſt place, though they be indeed the laſt and loweſt part of the world; they are neceſſary ſervants to a man, and as ſervants they are to be uſed; and whoſoever is reſpected in this world for his riches ſake, he is reſpected for his ſervants ſake, and not for his own: and indeed neither the Phyloſophers of Old, nor yet the Men of our Daies could ever make a true definition what
<pb facs="tcp:40322:3"/> Riches was, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch an one as could pleaſe me: <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> held Riches to be enough of things needful, but if that be true, then a Beaſt is as rich as a Saint. The <hi>Stoick</hi> Phyloſophers held riches to conſiſt in having enough Earth and Air, but if that be true, how ſhould a man do for Victuals? this preſent world holds riches to be enough of Gold and Silver, but what one of their enoughs is I know not, nor (I am confident) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neither.</p>

               <l>

               </l>
               <lg>
                  <l>—the event doth prove</l>
                  <l>As Riches doth encreaſe, ſo doth its love.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>The more Riches men have, the more they deſire, and they never know when they have enough; for if a covetous man had as many Needles as <hi>Pauls</hi> would hold, and as many Bags of Gold as all thoſe needles would laſt ſtitching, they would never be contented: beſides, if riches conſiſt barely in the enjoyment of money, then that man which <hi>Pliny</hi> (when <hi>Hannibal</hi> beſieged <hi>Caſiline,</hi> and there was a ſore famine in the Town) quotes, would be accounted a very rich man who ſold a mouſe for two hundred pence one day, and died himſelf for lack of food the next.</p>
            <p>But worthy Sir, It is not Riches I treat of in this Book, but Knowledg, and particularly the knowledg of a mans Body: I will not ſtand here to prove how much the exact knowledg of the Body conduceth to the mending or marring of the internal Faculties or Endowments of the mind, for that were but to trouble you in the midſt of your buſineſs amongſt your many Imployments, both private at home, and publick abroad for the good of this Nation, the laſt of which hath made your Name precious in the eyes of all honeſt people: neither ſhall I ſpend time in making an Apology why I appear in print in this Nature wherein I have ſo many Predeceſſors in the Engliſh Tongue; the reaſon is clear, Some of them are too large, others too ſhort, none of them have the Demenſions of Mans Body ſo exactly cut in Copper as you ſhall find them in this Book, wherein, as in a looking Glaſs, you may ſee man turned the wrong ſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and all his internal parts laid open to you view, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:40322:4"/> your ſpirit may be even raviſhed in the conſideration of the Wiſdom and Power of that God who hath made man in ſuch an abſolute form, ſo accurate in all his delineaments; if ſuch be the Creature, what is the Creator?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let me crave pardon, and I hope I ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, in preſuming to ſtamp your Name in the beginning of it: Truly your reallity to the good of this Nation was ſuch, and ſo ſtill continues even in that crooked and perverſe Generation in which we live, that I knew no other way how to ſhew forth a thankful mind to you than by doing as I have done: If it be accounted a fault, let it be venial, and let an honeſt intent find ſooner entertainment with you than a hare-brain'd action.</p>
            <p>The God of heaven and earth bleſs you with the Bleſſings both of this Life, and that to come, that you may go on in the good work as hitherto you have done, even till ſuch time as it pleaſeth him to let us enjoy one deſired Liberty. Sir I am</p>

            <p>The Divine and Immortal Mind proper to man is wiſe, and alike wiſe in all men, being one and the ſame in all points in all men; and this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proved becauſe God from whence it comes is one and the ſame; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then, is when it is divided and ſent into different places. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſpoken of that Noble <hi>Polonian,</hi> ſaith he, If you lay diverſe Colors round upon a Table at a diſtance one from another, imagine White lay here, and Green there, and Red there, Blue there, Salt in another place, Allum in another; now if you take a pot of fair clear Water, and powr down in the midſt of them, that which runs through the red Color will be red, and that which runs through the blue Color will be blue, and that which runs through the Salt will be ſalt, and that which runs through the Allum will be Allumy, &amp;c. and yet the water which is powred down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them is one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>Take another familiar Example or two, for things are better cleared by Examples than they are by themſelves: There are innumerable kinds of Lights in the world, that differ in form and bigneſs, according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that receives them; there are ſome great fires, and ſome little ones, ſome burn cleer, and ſome are ſmoky; there are ſome great Candles, and ſome ſmal ones, and ſome Torches, and yet the Sun from whence all theſe receive their light, is of it ſelf all one and the ſame in all places. Take another Example, which ſhall bring the matter a little cloſer home to the point, As the Sun of himſelf ever ſhineth and ſeeth all things, unleſs his beams be ſtopped by a cloud or ſome other thick matter; even ſo the Mind of Man conſidered alone by it ſelf, knoweth all things, but being entangled in the Body, and darkned by its cloudineſs and infirmities, it can ſee nothing without the leave and help of the Body; this courſe then the Mind is fain to take, conſidering her ſelf ſhe cannot ſtep forth out of the Body, nor range abroad to diſcern the Idea's of things as they are in themſelves, She is fain to take the demonſtrations of things as ſhe can receive them from the Body though they be in never ſo poor and deceitful a way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. She is forced to imploy the outward Spirits that keep their reſidence in the edg and border of the Body, I mean the five Sences, <hi>Seeing, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Smelling, Taſting,</hi> and <hi>Feeling;</hi> neither can theſe operate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their proper Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> The parts of the body where they lodg, viz. <hi>Seeing</hi> cannot ſee without the <hi>Eye,</hi> nor <hi>Hearing</hi> hear without the <hi>Ear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe bring in tidings to the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> The Shews, Shapes, and Idea's of things; yet cannot the Mind of man underſtand theſe without an Interpreter, therefore are there inward Beams or Sences which lodg in the
<pb facs="tcp:40322:5"/> Brain, three of them by Number, which take theſe tidings from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſences, and repreſent them as it were in a glaſs to the Mind, to wit, <hi>Apprehenſion, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> then the mind laying them altogether, and comparing one with another, judges of them, which is good, and which is bad, which is fit, and which is not fit to be done: Now if theſe Meſſengers of the Mind, or the places of the Body where they lodg, be foul, or groſs, or thick, they give either dull, or falſe information to the Mind; a Looking-glaſs if it be ſo corrupted will do the like to the face of the Body: Thus I think it ſufficiently proved that the afflictions of the Mind have their Original from the Body: And beſides I have taught you a little <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> though it belonged nothing at all to my preſent purpoſe. I hope you ſee by this time how beneficial the knowledg of the Anatomy of a Mans Body is to the rectification of the Endowments of his Mind; indeed, to his well-being both in this world, and that to come, if he mind vertue here, and intend to inherit happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>How requiſite it is to the Cure of the Diſeaſes of the Body, every one can tell you, and therefore I may hold my peace and not ſpend time in proving the Crow to be black, or the Swan white. Only this I deſire you to take notice of, and ſo I conclude, That whereas I have been vitupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated many times for being Critical in my Writings, I have altogether for born it here, though I confeſs I ſhall not pleaſe every body in this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whether a man go at one ſide of the ſtreet or the other the dogs will bark at him; and the man in <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> whether himſelf rid, or his boy, or both of them, or neither of them, could not pleaſe the next he met.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Veſlingus</hi> the Author of this Work which I have here Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he was (and for ought I know, or can hear, is ſtill) the publick Reader of the Anatomy Lecture at the famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> I confeſs I differ in Opinion from him in ſome few particulars, and but in few, especially where he makes the Heart the fountain of Blood, as alſo the Veins that carry it, wherein it is apparent that he drank too deep of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> spittle: I confeſs I paſſed it by in ſilence; diverſe are of that Opinion; let them give me leave to uſe mine, as I have given them to uſe theirs. As for the Braſs Cuts, they are performed very exactly, far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any that ever were printed in the Engliſh Tongue, inferior to none in the world. Truly, I wiſh this poor <hi>Nation</hi> much good by this Work, that the Lord would open their eyes, that they might ſee the truth and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and let them reſt confident, That whilſt I am amongst the Living, I ſhall never ceaſe to do them good according to my power.</p>

            <head>Joh. Veſlingus to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Emetrius</hi> ſacked <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and the Suburbs being taken, he threatned the City with Fire and Sword; they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Embaſſador, entreated him, that he would not burn the Table of <hi>Protogenis,</hi> placed upon the Wall; he readily anſwers, That he would ſooner burn the Image of his Father, than ſuch a piece of Workmanſhip; for the Workman had painted <hi>Jalyſus</hi> one of the <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in a Table, to wit, the Image of the Body drawn with a Penſil.</p>
            <p>What place then (my Reader) ſhould the Context it ſelf of the Body of Man, his inward Parts and Adornments, have in our minds, when <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſo chary of only the Shadow? Truly, the very ſame which the VVorkmanſhip of God ought to have, he being a delicate Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the whol world, by which alone the Eternal God ſhewed what he was able to do in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</p>
            <p>Men famous for VViſdom in Ancient times were raviſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this; although from the Age of <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> even to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> they were content with the curious Inspections only, and buried the Myſtery in ſilence, and left nothing to poſterity, till the exquiſite Knowledg of Mans Body inflamed Man with a greater deſire of Study, brought it out of darkneſs into light, as the moſt ſolid Foundation of that part of Phyſick called <hi>Phyſyology:</hi> Amongst the Ancients, <hi>Galen</hi> bears away the Bell in this part of Study, which is to be found in his Praiſe-worthy Works of Diſſection; afterwards in this latter Age, the Precepts of this Art being rectified, diligent men encreaſed the Art of Anatomy of the Body of Man, with profitable Obſervations; then it came into great Volumns, explaining the Functions confuſedly, and anſwering needleſs Queſtions; alſo Figures were added cut in Copper, to feed the Eyes of thoſe that had not opportunity to ſee the Diſſection.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40322:7"/>
            <p>In this ſo famous Anatomical Light, I have known not a few, profit but little by ſo great Labors, being wearied out with the bulk of the Books, and miſerably intangled in the ſnares of Controverſies; another ſpends all his time in contemplating the Figures, as though he were beholding the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> and being ignorant of the Subſtance, rejoyceth in the Image of things.</p>
            <p>To recal thoſe Errors, I framed this ſmal VVork, in the manner as we ſhew it in publick Diſſections of the Body of Man: I avoided Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which belong rather to Contemplatiſts, than the Theaters of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, which were built to behold, not to dispute in. I was leaſt of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about the Figures; for although very many ingenuous men have been very exact in them, yet he labors in vain, that labors to find the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural poſition of Parts, their magnitude, order, hardneſs, ſoftneſs, and as <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, their ſmoothneſs, proceſs, receſs, inſertion into another, or reception of another into themſelves, accurately by them.</p>
            <p>What ever it be, we would have it brief, and not enlarge it with many words, imitating that of <hi>Saluſtius</hi> of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Law; it is better to ſpeak few things here, then to paſs by many things with ſilence, ſeeing ſuch things as are preſcribed to yong men of the Body of Man, are ſcarce better done any where, than what here is laid down to faithful Eyes; and yet if you regard only the speech, you will deny, as <hi>Apelles</hi> did of the Table of <hi>Protogenis,</hi> that the work hath any grace; or if you regard the novilty of the ſtile; both of them I eaſily grant you, being not deſirous of Popular applauſe.</p>
            <p>I propound the Hiſtory of the Parts of the Body ſhewed in Diſſections; for what profits it to garniſh it with flouriſhes, which appears without spot in its Native Beauty, being the naked Workmanſhip of Nature: Neither thought I good to abſtain from the words already in uſe, leſt I ſhould ſeem to draw a cloud over other Mens Works, and darken the way to the Temples of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius.</hi> Moſt of it I drew out of the common Fountain, but the Manuduction is drawn out of my own Veſſel. I had to my Maſter, a famous man, <hi>Fabricius Bartoletus</hi> of <hi>Bonona,</hi> Chief Phyſitian to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you regard the Order, you are beholding to me for that; I digeſted it into ſo many Chapters, as publickly it is demonſtrated in Anatomies, and the Series of every Chapter is in the ſame manner as it is ſhewed to the eye in publick Diſſections; In the Breaſt I ſhew the Adductor of the Shoulder, and the Muſcles of the <hi>Scapula</hi> called <hi>Serrati,</hi> before the
<pb facs="tcp:40322:7"/> Intercoſtals, the Lumbal Muſcles after the Extenders of the back, the movers of the <hi>Scapula</hi> before the muſcles of the head and back: The reaſon that I joyn the Tongue with the <hi>Larynx,</hi> is it's ſingular nexure with the <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> and the <hi>Os Hyois</hi> with the <hi>Larinx;</hi> the bones of the Limbs are ſet before the Muſcles, ſeeing the greateſt part of them move the bones: to both I add the Nerves, Arteries, and veins, which the Divine Creator hath made common with the bones and muſcles. I did not treat of the Nature of ſimilary parts by themſelves for brevity ſake, ſeeing that belongs rather to Phyſiology, and without Tautology could not here be treated of.</p>
            <p>This I intreat of thee who ever reads this Work, That thou wouldeſt give thy mind as well to pardon failings, as to know the truth, if thou meeteſt with any, cauſed either through forgetfulneſs, or non-underſtn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: my ſerious intent was to lead ſuch young men as are ſtudious in Phyſick into the Knowledg of Anatomy; if my endeavors want ſtrength, thou canſt not in equity deny me pardon, ſeeing thou thy ſelf maiſt run upon the ſame Rocks in other difficulties.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you diſdain not to turn thy eyes and mind to the Corps of Man Artificially diſſected, whether the Profeſſion of Wiſdom or Phyſick delight thee, I promiſe thee here ſomething worth thy labor and not to be deſpiſed, for there is not the leaſt nor moſt abject part of Man, but by its admirable ſtructure thou maieſt know him that made thee, to be moſt wiſe, moſt powerful: Thou ſhalt find out the cauſes of all the actions, the conſent and concord of thy whol Body, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Health and Sickneſs, thou maieſt the better apply Remedies to afflicted parts; and in the time when Nature calls for remedy, thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not be hurried on with raſhneſs, nor retarded by fear.</p>
               <p>In the Body of Man, both <hi>Ventricles</hi> and <hi>Limbs</hi> are to be heeded; the common name of <hi>Limbs</hi> comprehends both Hands and Feet: we cal thoſe notable Cavities of the Body, <hi>Ventricles,</hi> in which Nature hath placed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe parts dedicated to diverſe actions, to ſettle their abode in. Of theſe are three.</p>
               <p>The firſt, which is the lower, is called the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and is internally compaſſed with the <hi>Pſritonaeum,</hi> it is called the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> becauſe it hides and involves all thoſe Bowels which are ordained for the preparation of the nouriſhment of the whol Body, the begetting of Children, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and cheriſhing of the Seed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, which is the middle, is bounded about with the <hi>Pleura,</hi> It is in the Fountain of vital heat and in it are the Lungues.</p>
               <p>The third, which is the higheſt, is included in the head, and ſtoutly defended by the Skull; in this, <hi>Plato</hi> placeth the Coeleſtial part of Man.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40322:9"/>
               <p>We, becauſe we would avoid putrifaction, begin the Diſſection at the lower <hi>Ventricle,</hi> or <hi>Abdomen,</hi> whoſe fore part, which is next the lower Cartilages of the Ribs, the ancients called <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> and is divided into the right and left; But the other, we of Modern times, very fitly call that part which is next the Stomach and the uppermoſt Guts, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrium;</hi> but that which contains the lower part of the belly, even to the groyn and privities, <hi>Hypocaſtrium,</hi> the middle, between the <hi>Epiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrium</hi> and <hi>Hypogaſtrium;</hi> we call the region of the Navil the back part of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the upper part of it is called the Loyns, the lower part the Buttocks.</p>
               <p>Of the parts of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ſome are common to the whol Body, ſome proper to its ſelf; the common parts are the skin, ſcarf-skin, fat, and fleſhy Membrane.</p>
               <p>The Skin is a Membranous covering of the Body, drawn over the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, defending them from injury, and giving judgment of tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects: I call it a Membranous covering, becauſe the ſubſtance is the ſame with a Membrane, and it is ſtretched abroad like it, yet it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from a Membrane in Temperament, conformation and office; it takes its original not from Blood, nor yet from the Veſſels, but from the Seed, and this, the firſt radiments of the <hi>Embrion</hi> in the womb teſtifies, which Nature compaſſeth about with a thin skin, even ſo ſoon as it is compacted; Hence alſo like other Seminal parts, even in a Blackmoors, under the black thin skin, it is white; neither when it is loſt doth Nature reſtore again the ſame, but another ſubſtance like it, which is called a <hi>Callus</hi> or Scar.</p>
               <p>It receives its quickneſs of ſence from the Nerves, not only the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of which, but alſo diverſe ſmall branches, are ſpread abroad in it, as is very cleer in the third and four pair of Nerves which paſs to the face and the ſixt pair which paſs to the Arms. It receives alſo many ſmall veins and Arteries that ſo it may be furniſhed with blood for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and vital ſpirit for quickning, that the coldneſs and dryneſs of it may be allayed, that part of of it about the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> is ſupplied by veins and Arteries from the <hi>Epigaſtricts, Lumbals,</hi> and <hi>Mammary</hi> branches.</p>
               <p>The Habit of the skin is altogether different, according to the variety of temperament, age, ſex, and region; The skin on the top of the head is thickeſt, that on the ſides thin, that on the face and palm of the hand thinner, and that of the lips thinneſt of all; that on the tops of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers is mean, that ſo the ſence of touching might be the more perfect. It hath very many paſſages or holes in it, of which ſome are wide, as the mouth, noſe, ears, eyes, and privities, &amp;c. ſeing they are neceſſary either to receive in food, or caſt out excrements, others are ſmall and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable by which ſweat and fuliginous vapors tranſpire.</p>
               <p>It is in colour naturally white, and ſticks looſly to the fat that is under it, ſo that in ſome places being cut, it may be blown up from it, as hath been tryed by ſome in that barbarous faſhion of cuting Leproſies; It ſticks faſt to the fleſhy membrane of the fore-head, as alſo to that of the ſoles of the feet, and the palms of the hands: So that the motion of thoſe parts, it is drawn into wrinkles together with it, by which as by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40322:9"/> 
                  <hi>Hieroglyphicks:</hi> the curioſity of mans brain hath drawn indications of things to come.</p>
               <p>A famous thin skin covers this skin externally, which the Greeks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acutely call <hi>Epidermis,</hi> the Latins <hi>Enticula,</hi> and we Scarf-skin; it takes its original from the dewy moiſture on the out ſide of the skin, which is made thick into that form, partly by the gentle and nouriſhing heat of nature, partly by the drineſs round about, whence it comes to paſſe that the <hi>Embrion</hi> being yet very tender, yet this though very ſoft is found about it; it obtains its firmneſſe by age, even ſuch a firmneſſe that ſometimes it reſtrains the excrements that paſs through the pores of the skin: It is extended all about the body where the skin is, and ſometimes through hot and fiery vapors that paſs through the pores, you may ſee it divided; as in ſuch caſes when we <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſay the skin pills off: It is all together void of life and ſence, and yet ſo firmly knit to the skin that it can hardly be ſeperated.</p>
               <p>Neither is the uſe of this Scarf-skin (though it ſeems ſo ſmal a buſines) ſmal, for without this could not the pores of the skin be covered, the continual moiſture of the body reſtrained, the body be made able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure heat and cold, nor the limbs be clenſed of durt and filth.</p>
               <p>Serpents ſeem yearly to caſt off this Scarf-skin; but the ſcaly skin is not a true Scarf-skin, but a thin membrane made of viſcous ſlime and filth, and the drineſs of the air about, the ſame happens to men in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, eſpecially upon their tongue.</p>
               <p>Underneath the skin is the fat, which is an unctuous or greaſy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body, produced out of the Oyly ſubſtance of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which lying like a mat about the body, not only defends it from the injury of cold, but alſo reſtrains the immoderate diſſipating, or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the internal heat; therefore in the Child even when it detained in the womb, it begins to grow, yet is it more in quantity, and thicker after it is born. Art imitates Nature in this, in that it puts Oyl upon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors which are full of Spirit, leaſt the Spirit ſhould exhale.</p>
               <p>The body is univerſally ſurrounded with it; if you except the Eye-lids, the lips, and the Privities of men: the office of which would be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated either by needleſs weight, or ſuperfluous moiſture: The fat is thickeſt about the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and loyns, mean upon the breaſt, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt upon the head, nature providently regarding and providing for the want of all places: the fat conſidered in it ſelf (<hi>Quatenus</hi> fat) wants both life and ſence, yet it receives both, from the <hi>Mammary, Lumbal,</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtrick</hi> branches of the arteries, and the ſtrings of the nerves which are mixed with it.</p>
               <p>The matter it ſelf from which it is produced ſhew its temperament to be moderately hot, mixed with an aerial moiſture: Its effects are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>viz.</hi> moderately to heat and attenuate, and more plentifully to moiſten. Alſo it is well known to profit much in pains of the ſides and joynts, to keep the hair from falling off, and to take away the deformity of ſcars. It grows moſt about the hotteſt parts of the body, and cannot poſitively take its original from cold: that kind of fat which is called <hi>Pinguedo</hi> is ſofter than that which is called <hi>Adeps</hi> (I ſuppoſe <hi>Adeps</hi> to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40322:10"/> that which we Engliſh vulgarly call Suet) and as it grows with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, ſo it melts without eaſe. It is joyned to the skin and to the membranes underneath it; and beſides the foregoing uſes, it moiſtens and refreſheth thoſe parts of the body appoynted for violent motions; laſtly it is placed in the intervalls of the Muſcles, to better their motion, and encreaſe their comlineſs.</p>
               <p>Underneath the fat of the whole body is ſtretched out the skin, which the Latins call <hi>Membra Carnoſa,</hi> and <hi>Panniculus Carnoſus.</hi> I know not what better verſion to give it then a [fleſhy membrane] Although in the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of a man ripe in years, it carries no fleſhy appearance at all, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fore-head, the Neck, the hinder part of the head, and the Ears, it hath an intertexture of Muſculous fleſh, and therefore it ſerves not only to keep the Fat in its due place, but alſo to divide one Muſcle from another, and all of them from the other fleſh: It obtains veins, Arteries, and Nerves from the neereſt branches to it; it is ſtretched out over all the parts of the body, even where the uſe of the Fat is either very little or none at all</p>
               <p>Its conſtitution is not alwaies ſingle; for in fat bodies you ſhall find it often double, ſometimes manifold in reſpect of temperature: it is cold and dry, which coldneſs and dryneſs is quallified by the neerneſs of the fleſh and Fat, it is exquiſite in ſence, anoyed by ſharp vapors, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſhakings, it ſticks cloſe to the Fat, to the Muſcles, to the ligaments of the bones, at which places it may eaſily be found.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 2. Of the Bones and Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and of the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe parts which are properly attributed to the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> are either external (which deſervedly bear the name of parts containing) or internal which we call parts contained; amongſt the external are numbred the Bones, the Muſcles, and the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> connexed with them.</p>
               <p>We begin with the Bones which are the drier parts of the body of man, and the harder, ordained for the ſtability of the whole body, the firmneſs of the joynts, and the ſtrength of voluntary motion.</p>
               <p>Their firſt ſubſtance, they have from the ſeed, and therefore they are all Carthilaginous at firſt, and grow ſolid in proceſs of time, they are long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt before they grow bony at the ends, which the Greeks call <hi>Epiphyſes,</hi> and the Latins <hi>Appendices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are covered with a notable membrane which is called <hi>Perioſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> of the veſſels they receive in, the Veins are evident, the Arteries more obſcure, and the Nerves obſcureſt of all; and yet the pain which is felt not in a few places, when they are laid open by the hand of the Chyrurgion, manifeſteth, that the Nerves penitrate not only to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal membrane, but alſo into the holes of the Bones themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is a mighty diverſity both in their magnitude and figure, ſo that they ought all to be handled in particular, and not in the univerſal: They are in number above three hundred, a great part of them are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed into <hi>Sinus,</hi> or ſtick out in heads, which nature hath covered with a ſoft cartilage as it were with a cruſt; that ſo the bowing of the joynts might be the ſafer and readier: part of them have cavities like long pipes, part of them have ſmall holes like Sponges, as the preſent bones of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> have; all of them abound with marrow, or with a juyce like marrow, whereby their cold and dry nature is not a little mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The joyning of the Bones is made the ſtronger both by Carthilages and Ligaments, of which the Cartilages are Spermatical parts uſually joyned to the Bones, but not ſo hard, that ſo the joynts may bend the better: The Ligaments are Spermatical alſo, and are ſofter than the Cartilages, although they are more or leſs ſoft according as they are round or flat: It is very fitting we ſhould take notice of the manner of their conjunction or joyning ſeverally.</p>
               <p>The Bones of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are but few in number, but of great bulk, occupying the lower and hinder part of it, in the fore part they are not neceſſary, leaſt they ſhould hinder the diſtention of the belly: Theſe be the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the loyns, the <hi>os Sacrum, Coccix,</hi> that which the Ancients
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40322:13"/> called the Bone without a name, vulgarly called <hi>Iſchium</hi> or <hi>Coxa,</hi> which containeth the <hi>Ilium, Coccendix</hi> and the Bones of the <hi>Pubis.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the loyns are in number five, ordained for the ſafe paſſage of the Marrow of the back, and the deſcending of the Nerves, the inferior are larger than the ſuperior, that they may the better hold up the back, they have various proceſſes which Authors call <hi>Apophyſes,</hi> of which two are tranſverſe, four oblique, two ſuperior, and as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, and one acute: the oblique proceſſes eſpecially ſtrengthen the joynts; the tranſverſe and acute, are for the convenience of the Muſcles: In the middle cavitiy of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> the Marrow of the back deſcends; other leſſer cavities are found about the ſides, where the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are joyned, to give paſſage to the Nerves of the loyns; they are joyned backwards by their oblique proceſſes, by that juncture which the Greeks call, <hi>Ginglymos,</hi> when there is a mutual reception between them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Hormonia;</hi> the reſt are joyned by <hi>Syndeſmos,</hi> or by the benefit of Ligaments, although they ſtick but looſly together, leaſt immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rigor ſhould make the bowing of the loyns difficult; but this being common to the reſt of the <hi>Vertebrae:</hi> I ſhall paſſe it by in few words.</p>
               <p>Under the loyns is the <hi>os Sacrum,</hi> being notable above all the reſt for its thickneſs and ſtrength, being the Baſis of ſo many <hi>Vertebraes</hi> which are above it; for the moſt part it conſiſts of ſix parts, which aemulate the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> growing narrower by degrees from abroad beginning; all of them being immovable, and in aged Perſons ſeeming to be but one Bone.</p>
               <p>Like an appendix to the <hi>os Sacrum</hi> is the <hi>os Coccix</hi> compoſed of three ſmall bones bowed forward for the more convenient ſitting of the man, their joyning together by Cartilages is but looſe, ſo that they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moved out of their places by the hard travail of women.</p>
               <p>On both ſides of this follows the <hi>os Ilium,</hi> which is the ſuperior part of the <hi>Coxa,</hi> or Bone without a name. It is large, ſtrong, and with a broad back. The gut called <hi>Ilium</hi> gave the name to this Bone, either becauſe its manifold circulations are neer it, or elſe becauſe it ſeems to be prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up by this Bone.</p>
               <p>To this is committed the <hi>os Coxendix,</hi> which others call <hi>Iſchium;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the <hi>Coxa,</hi> being alſo thick and firm, it hath a large Cavity like the ſaucers of the Ancients, into which the globous head of the thigh is placed and it is joyned to the ſides of the <hi>os Sacrum,</hi> firmly with a doubletye.</p>
               <p>Forwards from this on both ſides is ſtretched out the <hi>os Pubis,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the former; it is thin, and hath a great hole through it, leaſt its weight ſhould hinder the nimbleneſs of the body: on its extream parts it hath a Cartilage, and it is ſtrongly knit to the next bone of the ſide, both with a circular and membranous Ligament; neither yet is this knitting ſo tith but it may (like the former bones we mentioned) give way a little in the ſtrong travail of women.</p>
               <p>But this Deſcription of Bones (according to the conſent of moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) muſt be otherwiſe propounded, if we regard their Natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction as they are in the Bodies of Children; for in ſuch, even ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Urgent neceſſity requires Muſcles in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> for the expelling of excrements, to wit, Organical parts, endewed with fibrous fleſh, and ſtrong tendons, by which Nature endeavor the compreſſion of the belly and the parts therein contained. Of the Muſcles there are five pair, which by reaſon of the diverſity of their Operations, have obtained a diverſity of names.</p>
               <p>The firſt are, <hi>Obliquely deſcending,</hi> and are larger than the reſt, and have a very broad Tendon, which goes like two other ſubjects, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> in men, and the worm-like Ligament of the womb in women, neer to the Groyn: They take their beginning under the great <hi>Muſculus Serratus</hi> of the Breaſt, by unequal or toothlike productions, then they fall back, where the tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns end; in the middle of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> a concourſe of tendons being made, they end there, in a certain white line, they are furniſhed with Veins, Arteries and Nerves from the branches of the intercoſtals where they come to the breaſt.</p>
               <p>The next pair of the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is termed <hi>Obliquely Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending,</hi> ariſing neer the tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and the utmoſt brim of the <hi>Os-Ilium;</hi> riſing thence they joyn themſelves to the eleventh and twelfth ribs, and after by a doubled tendon they come to the right Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> they alſo end in the white line, they have their Veins and Arteries from the branches of the Veins and Arteries which are called <hi>Muſculae,</hi> whoſe original is from the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and the great Artery, about their diviſion into the Iliack branches, they have their Nerves from the Lumballs, and the lowermoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtals.</p>
               <p>The third pair are <hi>Tranſverſe Muſcles</hi> and have a Membranous beginning from the Tranſverſe Proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and paſſing by the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> they ſtick to the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and end where the other did; they participate of the ſame Veins, Arteries, and Nerves with the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles obliquely aſcending,</p>
               <p>The <hi>right Muſcles</hi> make the fourth pair, in which, by excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of the Creator, the <hi>Epigaſtrick</hi> Veins and Arteries aſcend, then theſe carriers of nouriſhment and vital heat deſcend by the internal mammaries neer the Cartilage called <hi>Mucronata,</hi> or through its cleft: The Anaſtomoſis of theſe Veins is very conſpicuous in women with child, and therefore the womb being much ſtopped, or compreſſed with great ſwellings, being ſtretched from the Groyn up to the Breaſts, they reſemble a channel, ſometimes of the thickneſs of a finger; They have their Nerves from the intercoſtals, ſtretched all along the middle of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> they are divided into two, three, and ſometimes into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40322:14"/> four inſcriptions, as it were into ſo many Muſcles, at the Cartilages of the Ribs, and the Cartilage of the breaſt, called <hi>Mucronata</hi> where they riſe, they are fleſhy, and they end in the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> where they are faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſtrong and tendinous body.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles called <hi>Pyramidales</hi> make up the fifth pair, the figure of which, eſpecially joyned together, being like a Pyramide, gave them their name; they take their baſis from the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> from which riſing and growing more ſlender by degrees, they admit their tendon into the white Line; they are auxiliary to the right Muſcles, and compreſs the lower parts the more ſtrongly, the ends of the right Muſcles Being fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy and broad ſupply the defect of theſe.</p>
               <p>But the four greater pairs which we mentioned, bind in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> for the expulſion of excrements, and alſo help the breaſt to avoid its flegm. An uſe alſo may be given of each of them ſeverally, and no obſcure one neither, ſeing they cheriſh the heat of the Bowels, and ad comlineſs to the part, we might mention the two Lumbal Muſcles here, ſaur and quadratus, but they more rightly belong to the Muſcles of the back.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the containing parts of the Abdomen, the laſt is the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> a Membrane ſo called which compaſſeth the Bowels about; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it only compaſs them, and keep them in, but alſo (by the conſent of no ſmall Authors) inveſteth them with their common skin, by reaſon of the variety of its Scituation, it hath veins and arteries from the <hi>Phrenici,</hi> the Muſcles of the Loyns, the Mammaries and Epigaſtricks, it hath Nerves from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt and Loyns, neither is this Membrana ſingle, for about the Reins, Ureters and Bladder, it is manifeſtly double, the forepart of it is thinner, it is thickeſt towards the back, in both places it is ſtrong, alſo by affluxion of humors it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſwells to the thickneſs of the skin, ſhewing a double tunicle eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where by reaſon of the humors within, being then alike in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Membranes which compaſs the bowels about.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> paſſeth not only to the <hi>Gula</hi> of the Veſſels above and beneath, and ſuch as outwardly compaſs about the child in the womb, but alſo to the worm-like Ligaments of the womb: Alſo in the Body of man, its proceſſes are conſiderable, for it gives two tunicles, in which the Spermatick Veſſels and Teſticles are wrapped; It is joyned in many places, both to the parts under it, and the Muſcles neer it to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> and the upper <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, from whence it is held to take its beginning.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 3.</hi> Of the Omentum, Stomach, and Guts.</head>
               <p>HItherto of the external part of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> we come now to the internal parts; of which, ſome perform the office of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick digeſtion, others the labor of begetting and conceiving the Child. Thoſe dedicated to publick digeſtion are, the Stomach, Sweet-bread, Liver and Spleen; Subſervient to theſe are, the Guts, <hi>Omentum,</hi> Gall, Reins, and Bladder: The Veſſels which reſpect the Generation, are, the Spermatick Veſſels of both Sexes, the Privities of Men, the Womb of Women; of which we ſhall ſpeak ſeverally as they come to Anatomical view.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the internal parts that comes to view is the <hi>Omentum,</hi> which the Ancients called <hi>Epiploon;</hi> it is a double Membrane filled with fat, which is joyned to the Stomach about the bottom, and ſpread over the Guts, that it may cheriſh thoſe bloodleſs parts by its gentle heat. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors deduce its inferior wing immediately from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior from the common tunicle of the Stomach; it hath Veins from the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and the ſuperiour wing hath the <hi>Gaſtroepiploica,</hi> both right and left, which are common to the ſtomach alſo; the inferior wing hath the right <hi>Epiploica</hi> and the <hi>Poſtica.</hi> Its Arteries are derived from the Coeliacal branch, and the Meſenteriack. Its Nerves are few and ſmal, and come from the plexure of the ſixt pair of the coſtal Nerves, and all this is that it might not be deſtitute of nouriſhment, life and ſence. It hath <hi>Glandulae</hi> ſcattered here and there, ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer, which like Sponges take away the ſuperfluous moiſture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Its largeneſs is various according to the diverſity of Bodies; In ſome it is not ſtretched below the Navil, and in ſome it is; the fatter it is, the heavier it is, ſo that in very fat Women it cauſeth barrenneſs: In all it is double, and the Tunicles being taken away between the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Spleen, and the Gut Colon, it often give a receptacle to wind and ſeroſus humors. Its fatneſs takes away its natural coldneſs and drineſs, and yet in falling down it is very ſubject to putrifaction for this very reaſon, It is joyned to the round lobe of the Liver, to the Sweet-bread, Spleen, and bottom of the Stomach, to the Gut Colon, which its office is to cheriſh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Omentum</hi> being taken away, the Stomach appears, being an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical part of the inferior Ventricle, which converts the foot being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and well chewed by the teeth into a white ſubſtance which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Chyle;</hi> it conſiſts of a three-fold Membrane, which is ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out when it receives in meat, and contracted again when it is dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; the outward Membrane is called common, and it is ſuppoſed to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40322:17"/> receive it from the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> the middle Membrane is more fleſhy, that ſo it may retain the more heat; the inner is fuller of Nerves and is the very ſame that cloatheth the inſide of the pallat, this is wrinkled and unequal for the better embracing the meat, and that it may not be ſuddenly vexed with the acrimony of juyces, it is defended with a mucilaginous cruſt, a delicate variety of <hi>Fibrae,</hi> is both in the middle and inner tunicle, ſtretched out, rightly, obliquely; and orbicularly, which gives ſolid ſtrength and eaſie motion to it.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach receives veins partly from the trunk of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> partly from the branches thereof, both from the right, which is called the Meſenterick, and from the left, which is called Splenical: From the trunk of the <hi>Vena porta</hi> ariſeth the vein which is called <hi>Vena gaſtrica dextra;</hi> others call it <hi>Pylorica,</hi> and it is divided about the lower Orifice of the ſtomach; from the Splenical branch ariſeth the vein called <hi>Gaſtrica major,</hi> which compaſſing about the ſuperiour region of the ſtomach, and the ſuperior Orifice in form of a Crown, is called <hi>Coronaria,</hi> and by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> joyns it ſelf to the <hi>Pylorica,</hi> then the leſſer Gaſtrial veins, and the ſhort veſſel, or ſhort vein, which is ſometimes within, ſometimes without the Spleen, is ſtretched out towards the bottom of the ſtomach; ſometimes it is not ſingle but manifold. Laſtly, the vein called <hi>Gaſtroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piploica ſiniſtra,</hi> which comes from the lower branch of the Splenical vein is diſtributed to the left ſide of the bottom of the ſtomach, as alſo to the <hi>Omentum:</hi> from the Meſenterick branch ariſeth the vein called <hi>Gaſtroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piploica dextra,</hi> which alſo is diſtributed to the bottom of the ſtomach, partly before and behind, and partly to the <hi>Omentum,</hi> and it receives <hi>Gaſtroepiploica ſiniſtra</hi> by Oſculations. All theſe you may ſee cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated in the Table of the following Chapter, figure the ſixt.</p>
               <p>The Arteries of the Ventricle or ſtomach, ariſe from the Coeliacal branch of the great Artery, from its right, and eſpecially its left bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and keep company with the veins like man and wife together: The Nerves give the animal Spirit from the external branch of the ſixt pair, both right and left, and are very copious about the upper Orifice; hence comes the ſence of that place to be ſo ready and exquiſite, and ſuch a wonderful conſent betwixt the ſtomach and the bowels, for that pair of Nerves, ſeing it is not beſtowed upon the ſtomach alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon the reſt of the parts of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> makes a great conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; we ſhall ſpeak of it here briefly, but ſhall deſcribe it and ſhew it fully in the Theater.</p>
               <p>There ariſeth a Nerve of the ſixt pair within the skul from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the marrow of the back, a little below the fifth pair which ſeems to ariſe out of the concourſe of very many ſmal Nervs having paſſed the Skull, it is knit to a Nerve of the ſeventh pair, and paſſeth to the tongue and the Muſcles of the bone <hi>Hyois,</hi> and on both ſides it is divided into an external and an internal branch.</p>
               <p>The outward branch of the right ſide, after it hath adminiſtred bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Muſcles in the Neck, then in its progreſs to the internal Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Larinx,</hi> then to the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Throat, between the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vein and the Artery called <hi>Carotides;</hi> it ſlips under the <hi>Clavicula</hi> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40322:17"/> the breaſt, certain branches which it ſent out being again united; they make that Nerve which is called <hi>Recurrens</hi> or running back, becauſe running back about the ſubclavian Artery, neer the right ſide of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-pipe, then into the Wind-pipe; then is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in the Muſcles of the <hi>Larinx;</hi> making its Progreſſe from thence, and giving ſmal branches to the <hi>Pleura</hi> and <hi>Pericardium:</hi> It is ſtretched out not only to the external tunicle of the Lungs; but alſo in the Lungs themſelves, to the <hi>Branchi</hi> of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> by many branches: At laſt having obtained the name <hi>[Stomachicall]</hi> it is divided into two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and penetrating both the <hi>Gula</hi> and <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> it embraceth the ſuperior Orifice of the ſtomach, with a Net like contexture of many ſmall Nerves, and it beſtows a ſmal Branch alſo upon the Liver.</p>
               <p>The Internal Branch of the ſixt pair on the right ſide, ſtrengthens its <hi>Fibrae,</hi> with a long, red, and callous ſubſtance: In its Progreſſe by the fore-part of the Neck, whilſt it applieth to that plexure, which is made of the cervical pairs of Nerves, and taking ſmall Branches from them, growing thick again by its own callous Body, it is carried to the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt; in which deſcending under the <hi>Pleura,</hi> neer the roots of the Ribs: A ſmall Branch being taken from each inter coſtall Nerve (whence it obtained the name <hi>Coſtalis:</hi>) at laſt having paſſed the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and ſent certain ſmall Branches to the Original of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> with the other Internal Branch which is its companion, it produceth a Nervous plexure, variouſly guarded with callous Bodies, from which by the right Region of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> Branches paſſe to the Guts to the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Liver, Gall, and right Kidney: The remainder of it, which is free from this plexure, is partly ſpent upon the <hi>os Sacrum;</hi> partly upon the bottom of the Womb, and right ſide of the Bladder.</p>
               <p>In like manner is the Nerve of the ſixt pair diſtributed by the left ſide of the breaſt and <hi>Abdomen;</hi> Save only the external branch of it bends back its <hi>Recurrens,</hi> under the trunk of the great Artery: Beſides it ſends a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Branch with very many Diviſions to the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and the Heart its ſelf; then it paſſeth to the Nervous plexure of the <hi>Meſcuterium,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its ſelf, partly united to the right Stomachical, having firſt ſent a ſpeciall Branch to the Liver. The left internal Branch of the ſixt pair, even as the right makes up part of the plexure we ſpake of before, from which it is carried to the left Region of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> the Spleen, and left Kidney: That part which avoids this plexure is ſent to the <hi>os Sacrum,</hi> the bottom of the Womb, and the left part of the Bladder.</p>
               <p>From this admirable pair of Nerves, we return now to the Stomach; the ſtructure of which in Man is ſingle, and the bigneſs mean: It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in Beaſts, becauſe their meats are harder in digeſtion. It is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the bottom or Cavity, and the two Orifices, of which that which is uppermoſt, and on the left ſide, our Anceſters propperly named the Stomach: It is garniſhed with many <hi>Fibrae,</hi> and Nerves cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed in an Orb: It is great and thick, and the ſeat of Natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>The inferior Orifice whichis on the right ſide, the Ancients called <hi>Pylorus,</hi> or <hi>Janitor;</hi> for by this the meat digeſted paſſeth to the next
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40322:18"/> Guts as by a gate; the heat of the Bowels, round about the Stomach, quallify its cold and dry Temperature: the Stomach is in form like the Bag of a pair of Bag-pipes; it is placed by the Wiſdome of God, in the left <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> under the <hi>Diaphragma:</hi> The right part is committed to the Liver, the left to the Spleen, below, it is cheriſhed by the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> and underneath it lies upon the Sweet-bread, as it were upon a Pillow.</p>
               <p>The ſuperior Orifice paſſeth to the Throat or <hi>Gula,</hi> about the eleventh or twelfth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt; the right or inferior Orifice paſſeth down to the Gut called <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and in this middle ſpace of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria,</hi> in which that Cartilage of the Breaſt called <hi>Mucronata</hi> is a little bowed inwards; make a Cavity of the Breaſt outwards, which the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latins call <hi>Foveam cordis,</hi> and we the pit of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>In this place we often feel pains in the ſtomach, which we falſly impute to the upper Orifice thereof: when indeed they ariſe either from ſharp or corrupt Food, or excrements, ſticking about the narrow paſſages of the <hi>Pylorus;</hi> or ſent up from the Gall thither. The various affections of the Sweet-bread being neer to the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> ad no ſmall part to this trouble; as alſo the faults of the Cartilage called <hi>Mucronata,</hi> whether it turn its poynt inwards or outwards.</p>
               <p>Now will we give this breife deſcription of the <hi>Gula,</hi> which is alſo called <hi>Oſaphagus;</hi> although it might more fitly be deſcribed with the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera Arteria,</hi> and the Lungues: Yet we will not ſeparate thoſe parts in word which Nature hath joyned together in deed. It is the channel by which both meat and drink deſcends to the Stomach: It is compoſed of juſt as many Membranes as the Stomach is.</p>
               <p>About its beginning, it is moved by three pairs of Muſcles, and the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> which cauſeth the deglution, or gulping in ſwallowing: The firſt pair is called <hi>Cephalopharigigaeus;</hi> ſent from the confines of the Head and Neck, and is ſtretched abroad in the Tunicle of the <hi>Pharingaeus:</hi> The ſecond pair is called <hi>Sphenopharingaeus,</hi> which inclining downwards is extended in the ſides of the <hi>Oeſophagus;</hi> the third pair is called <hi>Stylopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringaeus;</hi> it takes its beginning from the appendix called <hi>Styliforme,</hi> from whence deſcending with a fleſhy and round Body, it ends in the ſides of the <hi>Gula:</hi> Of theſe the firſt pair lifts up, the other dilate the <hi>Oeſophagus:</hi> the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Throat, ariſing from both ſides of the buckler like Cartilage, and opening tranſverſly by the back part of the Throat, by ſtopping the <hi>Gula,</hi> drives the meat downwards.</p>
               <p>It hath veins and Arteries in the upper part, from the jugular veins and Arteries, and from the internal Arteries called <hi>Carotides,</hi> Nerves from the external branches of the ſixt pair; in the Breaſt it hath Veins from the Branch without a fellow, Arteries from the intercoſtals, Nerves as before; about the Stomach it hath the ſame, that it hath at its upper Orifice.</p>
               <p>It hath many <hi>Glandulae</hi> which adminiſter moiſture to its membranes, for the eaſier ſwallowing, of which the ſuperiour are poſited at the ſides of the tongue and <hi>Larynx,</hi> the inferior which are many ſtick in the breaſt to the branches of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria.</hi> The <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> takes its beginning
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40322:18"/> from the extremity of the Jaws, where it is joyned to the <hi>Larinx,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtreight down to the Breaſt, firſt towards the right ſide, then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left: It pierceth the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> about the eleventh <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the back, and ſo is united to the ſuperior Orifice of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>As the Stomach is joyned to the <hi>Gula,</hi> ſo are the Guts to the <hi>Pylorus;</hi> they are ordained to take away the burden from the Stomach, to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and caſt out the excrements; they are covered with a Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſubſtance like the Stomach; they have a common tunicle largly ore-ſpread with the fat of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> for the better converſation of their heat; their propper Tunicle is double, intertexed with diverſe ſtrings, which give not only the greater ſtrength; but alſo the readier, motion; of the propper Tunicles, the middle moſt is moſt fleſhy, the inner more Nervous, ſlippery, and filled with wrinkles, both for their ſafegard, and the better to embrace what they have to embrace.</p>
               <p>The Guts have very many Veins; from the right Meſenterical branch of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and alſo from the left: they have Arteries from the upper and lower Meſentericals, they have Nerves from the ſixt pair derived from the Meſenterical plexure: to theſe come abundance of ſmall paſſages, for the Diſtribution of <hi>Chyle;</hi> which in this age <hi>Aſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was the firſt that brought to publique view. Of which more when we come to the Sweet-bread.</p>
               <p>The length of the Guts exceed the length of the Body of Man diverſe times, and lye in many foldings, that ſo they may keep what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the longer: their Temperature is cold and dry, which is aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both by the vital Spirit, and the Fat: Their form is, round, that ſo they may the better admit the Chile, and caſt out the excrements; they are underpropped by the Bones, which are gently knit to the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> but more eſpecially by the Membranous ties of the <hi>Meſenterium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are divided according to their Tunicles, into thin and thick: The firſt of the thin Guts <hi>Herophilus</hi> calls <hi>Duodenum;</hi> becauſe 'tis the breadth of twelve Fingers: this admits a pore from the Gall, by which ſharp humors it is provoked to expell the Excrements; it is of a great largeneſſe, that ſo it may unite the large Stomach to the ſmaller Guts.</p>
               <p>Neither yet (if the name pleaſe your fancy) are you to begin your Menſuration at the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> but to determine it at twelve Fingers breadth, that ſo you may avoid two errors. Firſt, That you give not part of the <hi>Janitor</hi> to this Gut. Secondly, That you be not led by that foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conceit, that mens Bodies were formerly bigger than they are now; which the Sepulchres of thoſe Kings and Prieſts in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> thoſe in the Pyramides in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thoſe Bodies which have been kept in <hi>Arabia</hi> in Mummy, many thouſand years; not exceeding the Bodies in <hi>Europe</hi> in bigneſs, eaſily witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>The next of the thin Guts is called <hi>Jejunum;</hi> becauſe of its emptineſs, which the ſwift deſcending of the Chyle cauſeth: where this emptineſs ends, the Gut called <hi>Ilium</hi> begins, and is the third of the thin Guts: It is ſo called from its manifold rings, or Circumvolections; it is longer than the reſt by far, and hath very many Veins, and Arteries; but it is narrow, and thence it comes to paſſe that the internal Tunicles being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40322:19"/> broken by a deadly ſtoppage, it cauſeth that diſeaſe called the <hi>Iliack paſſion:</hi> the office of the ſmall guts is to receive the <hi>Chyle</hi> and keep it that it may the better be diſtributed.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the thick guts is called <hi>Caecum,</hi> becauſe it hath no paſſage into another of the extream guts; this is very ſmall in ſuch as are grown up to age, and hangs like the worm like proceſs to the beginning of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and the end of the <hi>Ilium,</hi> and yet it is not to be excluded from the number of the Cuts, becauſe in children 'tis alwaies full of excrements, and performs the ſame office with the thick Guts</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colon</hi> is the ſecond of the thick Guts, and is larger and wider than the reſt, it hath a ſmal ſhut which ſerves to ſtop the excrements and wind that they may make a little delay in paſſing downwards: It riſeth about the right <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and is joyned to the Kidney next to it, from thence bending under the Liver it is knit to the <hi>Omentum,</hi> the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſtomach, the Spleen and left Kidney, from whence bending back it ends in the right Gut; it hath a proper bond of its own by which the order of its Cells are contained; it hath alſo a ſpecial Ligament by which it is knit both to the inferior and ſuperior parts.</p>
               <p>The third of the thick Guts by reaſon of the manner of its extenſion, is called the right Gut, this by its proper and middle tunicle is far more fleſhy than the reſt, and full of right ſtrings; the lower part of it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſtrong Muſcles, to wit, <hi>Sphincter,</hi> by which it is drawn together, and two <hi>Levators</hi> by which it is lifted up; The <hi>Sphincter</hi> is joyned to the lower parts of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and is ſpread about the Fundament with fleſhy and tranſverſe ſtrings, to which a thin Muſcle is joyned both in body and office, in the extremity of the fundament, being about a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bredth, and as it were compact in the skin. The Muſcles called <hi>Levators</hi> ariſe from the Ligaments of the <hi>Coxendix</hi> and <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> by a diſtinct portion they deſcend to the <hi>Sphincter;</hi> in men they joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the root of the Yard, in Women to the paſſage of the Womb.</p>
               <p>The Hemorrhoidal Veins are ſcattered about the right Gut, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal of which, moſt uſually ariſeth from the left Meſenterical of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> but ſometimes from the right, ſometimes from the Spleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal branch of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> ſometimes from within the Spleen, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from without; the external Hemorrhoidal veins proceed from the Hypogaſtrick branch of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and are diſtributed to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that move the Fundament.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Arteries which accompany the Veins, part of which come from the inferior Meſenterick branch, and part from the Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick Artery, to thoſe ſmal Nerves adjoyn themſelves which proceed from the extremity of the Marrow of the Back, and as it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon office of the thick Guts to gather the excrements together, and provoke them to expulſion, ſo it is the property of the right Gut to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them till occaſion ſerve to caſt them out.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 4.</hi> Of the Meſenterium, Sweet-bread, Liver and Spleen.</head>
               <p>THE moſt wiſe Creator of Man, hath taken care by the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> that the manifold foldings of the Guts might not come into a confuſion, and ſo mans health be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered thereby; It is a double Membrane, furniſhed with <hi>Glandulae</hi> and fat, joyned to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> fitted to cheriſh the Bowels as well as to keep them in Office and Order; a famous number of Veins are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it from the right Vein of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> joyning themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by many Oſculations, even before thoſe ſmall branches go to the Bowels. The Arteries are not inferior to theſe, which proceed from the Meſenterical ſuperior branch of the great Artery, and alſo from the inferior: It hath many Nerves from the plexure of the internal of the ſixt pair, and the Marrow of the Loyns.</p>
               <p>To theſe belong thoſe paſſages which carry the Chyle, which the firſt obſerver of them, called <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> becauſe of their white colour; but this as it may be ſeen in the diſſection of live creatures, ſo the creatures being dead, and the diſtribution of Chyle ceaſing, the whiteneſs cannot be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>And yet it often happens, that by reaſon of the intemperancy of men, abundance of humors flowing through ſo many Veſſels, the pores which carry the Chyle are obſtructed or (in plain Engliſh) ſtopped, and the Juyce being putrified, it cauſeth feavers, the cauſe lying in the <hi>Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The largeneſs of the <hi>Meſenterium</hi> is great, being encreaſed by fat which corrects the cold and dry temperature of the Membranes by heat and moiſture; it ſticks ſtrongly to the uppermoſt and third <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Lyons, and binds the foldings of the Guts, every where firmly to its ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Sweet-bread <hi>[Pancreas]</hi> is a Glandulous part of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> very profitable for attenuating and purging the Chyle, and preparing it for the Liver and Spleen before it be turned into blood, for as Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the blood it ſelf, which is either for nouriſhment of the fruit in the womb, or to make ſeed for the Generation of it, by diverſe degrees or ſteps, even ſo the Juyce which it turns into blood, it alters it in the mouth, concocts it in the Stomach, eaſeth it of excrements by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, and by the ſweetneſs of the Sweet-bread, frees from ſharp and ſalt humors, and therefore the Sweet-bread is alwaies full of <hi>Chyle,</hi> as you may find if you diſſect a creature alive, and cut it with a knife.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40322:22"/>
               <p>It receives the <hi>Chyle,</hi> and having received it, ſends it to the Liver; not by any veins or arteries deſcending from the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> but by ſpecial paſſages, which by reaſon of their colour, <hi>Aſellius</hi> named <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> as I told you before: they are long and round Veſſels with a very thin Membrane, very ſmall, aſcending upwards from the Sweet-bread, to the Liver; about the place where the trunk of the <hi>Vena porta</hi> deſcends, they paſs downwards to the Guts with very ſmall branches; they have very ſmall ſhutters which hinders the regreſs of the juyce they draw to the Guts; the knitting of the Sweet-bread to the Spleen ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perſwarde a man that they paſs thither than any paſſage yet found out; and yet it is certain they do paſs thither, becauſe they convey a watry portion of <hi>Chyle</hi> not yet coloured to the Spleen.</p>
               <p>The Original of the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> is deduced from no place ſo fitly as from the Sweet-bread; for as Nature produceth all veins and arteries from the trunk, from which the branches are diſtributed throughout the Body, ſo the foundation of the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> is at the Sweet-bread, and the branches paſs to the Liver and Guts; and yet the Creator of all things would not bring them into one common Trunk, by reaſon of the latitude of the Sweet-bread; as the Nerves which are the Organs of the ſences though they ariſe from one ſpring, yet is their intervals in their originals, the Splenical branch of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and the left Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liacal Artery, as alſo ſmall Nerves from the Gut <hi>Duodenum,</hi> paſs through the Sweet-bread, and yet it hath a proper Vein of its own, from the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and Arteries from the left Coeliacal, and a thin skin from the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> which incompaſſeth it round.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a moſt obſervable and ſingular channel in the Sweet-bread, lately found out by our <hi>Verſungus,</hi> which to a curious eye carries the ſtructure and ſhew of a vein: It ariſeth from the Gut called <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ſometimes in the extremity of the biliar pore, having a common Orifice with an outward ſhut, ſometimes neer the biliar pore, from a diſtinct place; it is ſtretched tranſverſly in the Sweet-bread with ſhort, yet very many branches; it is wide at the beginning, and conſumes by degrees before it come at the extremity of the Sweet-bread; ſometimes it is double in man, but unequal in length, and ariſeth neer the biliar pore at about a fingers breadth diſtance.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this channel is no waies hard to be found out, for ſeeing it brings a certain ſharp juyce not unlike to the Gall, it ſeparates the juyce of its own Nature from the <hi>Chyle,</hi> and carries it away to the Gut <hi>Duodenum,</hi> and therefore this being ſtopped, the Sweet-bread ſwels by reaſon of the excrements retained; and ſo, many veſſels being by this means compreſſed, the Liver and Spleen receive no ſmall damage.</p>
               <p>The Sweet-bread in fat men is bigger, and in ſuch as die not through default of Nouriſhment, it is of a cleer white colour, and therefore of old it was called <hi>Lactium:</hi> It is ſtretched out tranſverſly under the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach towards the Spleen, being more diducted towards the Liver; it hath a wonderful nexure with the Liver, by proper veſſels and paſſages compaſſed about with a Membrane: It ſticks cloſe alſo to the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> as though it drew a part of its Chyle from it; its copulation with the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40322:22"/> Spleen is not ſo ſtrong, and beſides its former offices, it cheriſheth the Stomach.</p>
               <p>The Liver ſucceeds this, being a famous part in the lower ventricle, being the ſhop, or work-houſe of Blood and Natural Spirit: Its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is fleſhy, like congealed blood, whence <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> gave it the name <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> in the <hi>Embrion</hi> like other parts produced of ſeed, it is white, only the ſmall Veins in it look red, then it looks yellowiſh by degrees, till at laſt it get the perfect colour of blood; and yet there are ſome living Creatures that although the blood in the Veins be red, yet the Liver is white, yellow, or green, it is covered with a thin ſingle Skin, ſticking round about cloſe to it.</p>
               <p>It hath Veins of two ſorts, the ſuperior, or <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which by its great trunk carries blood from the Liver, and diſtributes it throughout the Body: The inferior, or <hi>Vena porta,</hi> the branches of which are more in number, from which the umbilicate Vein ariſeth to the Child in the womb, and without the Liver, the branches the Splenical and Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terical Veins paſs, which diſtribute blood to the Spleen <hi>Omentum,</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Guts; a freequent conjunction is made between theſe, that ſo the blood may be diſpenſed the more perfectly, the more eaſily. Some few Arteries accompany the Veins about the Liver, from the right Coeliacal branch of the great Artery, and two ſmall Nerves from the right internal of the ſixt pair, and the external left Stomachical.</p>
               <p>The magnitude of the Liver in Man is great, and its figure almoſt round, it is divided into two parts, bending and hollow; the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bowed, fits its ſelf to the levity of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the other is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, and more unequal, for it ſticks out in a <hi>Lobus,</hi> and is hollow with a double <hi>Sinus,</hi> the one of which holds the Gall, the other embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth part of the Stomach: Laſtly, by a notable cleft it ſends out the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicar Vein, which in Men grown up, is hardned to a Ligament. The temperature of the Liver is hot and moiſt, that ſo it may the better concoct the blood.</p>
               <p>Above, it is joyned to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and to the Cartilage of the Breaſt called <hi>Mucro nata,</hi> by a ſtrong Membranous Ligament: backwards it is joyned by the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the loyns; below, it ſticks to the <hi>Abdomen</hi> by the umblicar Ligament; it is placed under the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and the Cartilages of the ribs, on the right ſide of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and embraceth the Stomach, and cheriſheth it by its kind heat.</p>
               <p>The Gall is joyned to the Liver, and is the receptacle of the cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick juyce of the Blood: It is compoſed of two Membranes, whereof the outer is common to the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> the inner which is propper to the Gall, is thicker and furniſhed with <hi>Fibrae</hi> of all ſorts, for its better moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and greater ſtrength: Alſo it is defended, with a certain cruſt againſt the acrimony of the ſubſtance it contains. It hath Veins from the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and ſmall Arteries from the right Goeliacal. It hath a Nerve from the plexure of the Coſtalls: it hath peculiar paſſages into the Liver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the roots of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Vena porta,</hi> whereby it draws its Choller.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40322:23"/>
               <p>It is divided into the bottom which is wider, and the Neck which is narrower: a narrow channel goes from the Neck of it, with ſhutters to keep the Choller from running back, which ends in the biliar pore; the narrowneſs of which is the cauſe that often times the thick excrements of the Gall breads ſtones in it, though not very hard ones, ſometimes round, ſometimes angular; and ſometimes like a Mulberry both in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and form. The Gall is in the right <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Liver, and firmly joyned to it, both by its upper and middle part.</p>
               <p>The Biliar pore is ſomething larger than the channel of the Gall, and carries Choller from the Liver to the Gut <hi>Duodenum:</hi> It is carried into the <hi>Duodenum</hi> by an Oblique flexure between the Membranes; uſually 'tis ſingle, but ſometimes double towards the end: It ſeldom reacheth to the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and as Nature expels choller by the channel of the Gall at ſet times: by this pore it is adminiſtred by degrees, and continually, both when the <hi>Chyle</hi> is diſtributed, and before; as is cleer in the diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Creatures alive.</p>
               <p>The Ancients held Choller to be the poyſon of the Body, the worſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of Blood, and that not a few living Creatures wanted it; becauſe they could find no Gall anexed to the Liver: but all Creatures that have Blood, have this Biliar pore, and if the Body be diſpoſed according to the law of Nature: this hot and ſharp humor both defends the <hi>Chyle</hi> from putrifaction, and cauſeth the excrements eaſily to be expulſed, and ſtrengthens the Bowels, by which means health is firmer, and life the longar.</p>
               <p>Over againſt the Liver, is the Spleen, being an Organical part of the inferior Ventricle, which receive the watry, and earthy part of the <hi>Chyle</hi> to be turned into Blood, its ſubſtance is fleſhy; yet looſer than that of the Liver, being like a Sponge to drink up copious humors, and therefore when it is obſtructed, it ſwells mightily; it hath one ſingle skin which Authors aſign to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> it hath Veins from the Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> which are as ſmall as hairs: Its Arteries are more in number, and more famous (by reaſon of which, it hath much vital heat) and thoſe from the left Coeliacal branch: It hath Nerves from the left branch of the coſtals of the ſixt pair, and from the Nervous plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> diſperſed by the exterior parts.</p>
               <p>The magnitude of the Spleen is bigger in melancholly Men than in others; its temperature, by reaſon of the abundance of Arterious blood it receives, is hot and dry: It is of a blackiſh purple colour in youth, of a leaden colour in age; it is in form hollowiſh in the internal face, gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous on the external, and not much unlike to a Neats-tongue; although this be not alwaies, for ſometimes it is greater, firmer, with ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct lobes of the colour of thick Blood, ſo that it ſeems to be like to the Liver, not only in form, but alſo in office: Its place is in the left <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> a little lower than the Liver, it is knit to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and to the Cartilaginous ribs, and to the left Kidney, by its bowing part; but by its hollow part to the <hi>Omentum,</hi> Stomach and ſweet-bread, by other veſſells, and its own Membranes</p>
               <p>All the learned agree, that the office of the Spleen, is to draw the watry
<pb facs="tcp:40322:25"/>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40322:25"/> and earthy part of the <hi>Chyle:</hi> the Blood being made of the purer part, but nature hath clouded the paſſages by which this is carried to the Spleen, for no obſervation as yet hath diſcovered any paſſages of the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> into it, and that it is not carried by the Splenical Vein, the diſſection of Creatures alive witneſſeth; as for the Arteries, their office is to carry vital Spirit to it.</p>
               <p>And yet it is agreeable to reaſon that it ſhould draw it from the Sweet-bread it ſelf, though by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of the paſſages it is not manifeſt, and it may poſſibly draw the ſaid juyce from the Stomach, which lies neer it, and for this the ſubſtance of the Spleen, its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vital Spirit, its ſicitaſion, and the diſeaſes it is ſo often moleſted with, ſeems to plead.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 5.</hi> Of the <hi>Kidneys, Ureters,</hi> and <hi>Bladder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe moſt wiſe Creator of the Body of Man hath ordained the Reins, or Kidneyes, to receive that thin moiſture which is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the making of Blood; they conſiſt of a thick fleſhy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, leaſt the continual, and copious flowing of moiſture to them ſhould weaken them: If you would ſearch into them, you muſt of neceſſity remove the Membranes wherewith they are covered, and they indeed are two; the one external, common to the reſt of the bowels by the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaenum,</hi> the other internal; the external is endewed with much Fat, which gave names to the Veins and Arteries Paſſing to it.</p>
               <p>Beſides them, on both ſides is a glandulous Body, which is called <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula renalis, Ren. Succenturiatis,</hi> and the <hi>Capſula</hi> of melancholly: It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with a thin skin, furniſhed with veſſels of all ſorts: the right <hi>Glandula</hi> often receives a Vein from the trunk it ſelf of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which is ſhort, yet wide, going into its <hi>Sinus</hi> with a wide Orifice, and ſometimes it takes it from the next emulgent Vein, as the left doth; its Arteries proceed from the emulgents, and Nerves from thoſe which are communicated to the Kidaeyes, their magnitude is not alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40322:26"/> they are uſually as big as that drug we call <hi>nux Vomica;</hi> if the Man be any thing ancient, their form is like the Kidneyes, long, and ſomewhat depreſſed; ſomtimes the upper part of them is angular: they have a Cavity within filled with black and melancholly matter, their colour is ſometimes reddiſh, and ſometimes like Fat.</p>
               <p>They are placed under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> above the fatty Membrane, ſo as the right is joyned to the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> the left is a little under the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; what their uſe is, is not yet ſuffciently found out; 'tis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they help the paſſage of the ſeroſus moiſture, and contract a part of the melancholly, which like a Runnet helps to ſeperate the urine from the Blood, alſo to underprop and cheriſh the parts next it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes there are more and leſſer <hi>Glandula</hi> furniſhed with Veins and Arteries, which Nature diſpoſeth about the Kidneyes.</p>
               <p>But the internal and propper Membrane of the Kidneyes, binds the Kidneyes themſelves ſtraight about: To which Kidney come large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to wit, a Vein, and an Artery, both of them known by the name <hi>Emulgent:</hi> The Emulgent Vein is ſomething unequal in ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeding from the trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> being double at firſt, and then diſperſed in diverſe divided Branches: alſo the Emulgent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is almoſt as big as the Vein, and ariſeth from the trunk of the great Artery, and brancheth it ſelf into the Reins as the Veins do: the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Emulgent veſſels is often different, and their progreſſe to the Kidneyes unequal, Nature providently regarding its own ſcope; to theſe ſome ſmal Nerves are added, from the plexure of the internal branch of the ſixt pair, to which the left Stomachical branch comes.</p>
               <p>The Kidneyes have fleſhy knobs, called <hi>Papillares,</hi> becauſe they are like tears, they are about the bigneſs of a Bean, and about ten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, diſpoſed with certain intervals, that ſo by their ſmal pores the urine may paſs cleer to the ureters.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Creator of Man hath formed two Kidneyes, by reaſon of the multitude of humors they are to ſeperare, and that if either of them be at fault, the other might be ſubſervient to him; they are in form like to a french Bean (which from them, were called Kidney Beans) outwardly bowing, inwardly unequally hollow: It is monſtrous when both of them ſtick together, or when they are ſo bowed that both ends touch, or when either of them is double; yet their ſurface is often unequal by reaſon of <hi>Glandulae</hi> that ſtick to them, in the conception, and remains e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The copiouſneſs of water that continually flows to the Reins, mitigates their hot and dry quallity: the right Kidney lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Liver, the left under the Spleen, neer the Muſcles of the loyns called <hi>Pſoas:</hi> The right Kidney lies loweſt, by reaſon of the bigneſs of the Liver, both of them are joyned to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and loyns by the outward Membrane.</p>
               <p>The Ureters receive the urine, being ſeparated by the Reins, and carry it to the Blader, they are round channels compoſed of a double Membrane, the exterior of which they have from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> for their ſtrength ſake; the interior is propper to themſelves, ſtrong and Nervous, endewed with many right and oblique ſtrings, they have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40322:26"/> ſmall Veins and Arteries from the next deſcending veſſels, and ſmall Nerves from the Plexure of the ſixt pair, and from the loyns; they are uſually in number two, ſometimes more, the third deſcending from the left Kidney neer the ſecond.</p>
               <p>They take their beginning from that looſe and membranous <hi>Sinus,</hi> which Authors call <hi>Infundibulum renum,</hi> from which they paſs within the ſmall pores of the Reins, and their extremities being opened, they take in thoſe fleſhy knobs called <hi>Papillares,</hi> which we ſpake of before, to which they are uſually equal in number; then contracting themſelves, they deſcend and paſs above the Muſcles <hi>Pſoas,</hi> and paſs into the Bladder toward the lower part thereof between the Membranes.</p>
               <p>The Bladder is an organical part of the inferior Ventricle, which keeps the Urine it receives from the Kidneys, and expels it when the weight or acrimony of it makes it troubleſom; it conſiſts of a three-fold Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, the external of which, the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> beſtows, the other two are proper to its ſelf, of which the middlemoſt is thickeſt and full of fleſhy ſtrings, and is of great concernment for the expulſion of the Urine; the innermoſt is thin and quick of ſence, and defended from the ſharpneſs of the Urine by a mucous cruſt: It hath veins and arteries from the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtricks; Nerves from the lower internal branches of the ſixt pair which touch not the plexure of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> and alſo from the <hi>Os Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> not only age, but alſo its violent ſtretching alters its magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>It is divided into the bottom and the neck; the bottom is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and wider part of the Bladder, from which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachos</hi> paſſeth to the Navil; which is wider towards the bottom, but grows ſlender by degrees towards the Navil; this when man grows to any age, together with the Umbiliar Arteries, makes that ſtrong Ligament of the bladder, by help of which the bottom of it is detained, which elſe would be depreſſed by the Bowels lying upon it, (which ſee more at large in the Tenth Figure of the Second Chapter) and yet ſometimes it happens even in ancient people, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachos</hi> being looſned by ſome violent means, gives way to the Urine by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>The neck of the Bladder is the inferior part, more narrow, more fleſhy: The ſtrings of this being caſt in a circle, makes the <hi>Sphincter</hi> which ſhuts the paſſage that the Urine may not flow from us whether we will or not: The Bladder hath three paſſages, of which, two are obſcure, by which the Urine paſſeth into it by the Ureters; one greater, by which it paſſeth out: It is in form like a Pear, and poſſeſſeth the bottom of the inferior Ventricle; the bottom of it is faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachos,</hi> the Neck in Men to the right Gut and the <hi>Glandulae proſtatae;</hi> in Women to the Neck of the Womb and the <hi>Os Pubis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between the Bladder and the Reins, in the publick order of Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, there is worth the obſervation, the deſcending Trunks of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and the great Artery, although Nature ſeldom keep the ſame order in the number, magnitude, and ſcituation of the branches. The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40322:27"/> 
                  <hi>Vena Cava</hi> after it hath ſent out the Emulgent under the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the Spermatical veins paſſing downwards, it ſends out three or four Lumbals and diſtributes them to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row included in them, the ſuperior of which paſſing upwards are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> to the deſcending branches of the internal Jugular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Os Sacrum;</hi> the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> being placed under the great Artery, is divided into two great branches which are called <hi>Iliacks,</hi> to wit, the internal and external, from which the ſuperior <hi>Vena Muſcula,</hi> and <hi>Vena Sacra</hi> proceed. From the internal Iliack branch, which is the leaſt, ariſeth the <hi>Muſcula Glutea,</hi> and the famous Hypogaſtrick vein, which gives branches to the longitude of the neck of the Womb, to the Muſcles of the bladder and right Gut, and to the <hi>Os Sacrum:</hi> from the external Iliack branch, which is the greateſt, after the internal Iliack the Epigaſtrick vein, which is double in Women and proceeds to the neck of the Womb and the Privities, the remainder of it after it hath paſſed the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> makes the <hi>Crural branch,</hi> which we ſhall ſpeak to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The progreſs of the great Artery is not much unlike to this, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath brought forth the former Meſenterick Artery; then the Coeliacal; afterward, the Emulgent, Spermatick, and inferior Meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, the Lumbals, and that which is called <hi>Sacra:</hi> It is divided about the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> into Iliack Branches, of which the interior produceth the Arteries, <hi>Muſcula</hi> and <hi>Hypogaſtrica</hi> which keep the ſame pace with the Veins; the exterior brings forth the Epigaſtrick and the <hi>Pudenda,</hi> that which is remaining deſcends to the Legs, and makes the Crural Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 6.</hi> Of the Inſtruments of Generation in Man.</head>
               <p>BY theſe Organs the Nutriment is wrought or made by which the frail Nature of Man is ſuſtained, which periſhing by age is ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by poſterity.</p>
               <p>Of theſe in Men, ſome perfect the ſeed, others ſow it in the fruitful field of Nature being perfected: of the firſt are the preparing veſſels, the <hi>Pampiniforme,</hi> the <hi>Epididymides,</hi> the Teſticles, the <hi>Paraſtatae,</hi> the <hi>Vaſa deferentia,</hi> and the veſſels that keep the ſeed: Of the latter are the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that caſt out the Seed and the Yard.</p>
               <p>The preparing veſſels are two veins, and as many arteries; the right of the veins ariſeth moſt commonly from the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſingle or double root; the left moſt commonly ariſeth from the left Emulgent, ſo that in their original the ſcope or paſtime of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is obſerved. The Arteries moſt commonly ariſe from the Trunk of the great Artery, and paſs down ward being mixed with the veins; they enter the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and by their manifold plexure they make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies called <hi>Pyramidalia,</hi> becauſe from a narrow beginning they become broad like a Pyramide; they are called alſo <hi>Pampiniformia</hi> becauſe they are curled like the Claſpers of a Vine, from thence they tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and are diſtributed to the <hi>Epidydimis</hi> and the Teſticles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epididymides</hi> are ſmall, white, hard glandulous bodies, covered with the common tunicle of the Spermatick Veſſels, they are longiſh and hollowiſh, where they are committed to the Teſticles, ſometimes they are ſo big that on the one or other ſide they repreſent another Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle; they lie neer to the Teſticles, to whoſe proper Membrane, with very many ſtrings and paſſages they are joyned; here is alſo a nexure found about the extremity of each Teſticle, for they lie rather in the middle ſpace than ſtick to them; their office is to give their firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Seed to the blood the preparing veſſels bring in, and commit it to the Teſticles for the perfecting of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epididymides</hi> are the Teſticles joyned, ſo called, becauſe they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtrength and man-hood; they have a glandulous white and ſoft ſubſtance, having ſmall Veins and Arteries from the Spermaticks, moſt neatly diſtributed in them; they have Nerves partly from the internal branch of the ſixt pair, which declines the plexure of the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> partly from the marrow of the back, that they may have ſence as well as life and nouriſhment; they are compaſſed about with a proper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of their own, ſtrong and thick, which becauſe it is white in color, they call <hi>Albuginea;</hi> the Divine Creator hath formed two of them, that ſo the work might be done by the other when the one languiſheth, or is deficient.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40322:30"/>
               <p>In reſpect of manifeſt quality; they are hot and moiſt, not becauſe they have a fountain of heat which they diſtribute to the body, for the changes that happen to the Body when they are loſt, either in voice, temperament, or ſtrength, comes through defect of any Natural heat flowing from the ſtones, but from the oppreſſion of that copious matter which uſeth to be converted into Seed: in form they are almoſt oval, both for ſecurity ſake and alſo for capacity; they hang in men without the <hi>Abdomen</hi> that ſo they might not be ſo luſtful, and that the matter whereof the Seed is made, might be the better perfected by the length of the paſſage, to which the Teſticles ad ſtrength and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>For it is an error to hold that their hanging down conduceth any thing at all to the caſting out of the Seed, becauſe the Seed is received from them, being made fruitful by the ejaculating Veſſels which are far remote from them; neither do they change, or any way fruſtrate the office of the Yard; they contain Seed, but ſuch as is very thin, as is ſeen by Carcaſſes not conſumed by diſeaſe nor faſting, and therefore it receives its laſt perfections in the Seminal veſſels, and <hi>Proſtatae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Epididymides</hi> are joyned the <hi>Paraſtatae Variciformes,</hi> ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reſemble the form of veins when they are ſwelled, crooked and bowed for the better elaborating of the Seed; they are Nervous and hard in the touching: from theſe whatſoever is carried upwards into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> is turned back to the Bladder, and is called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſecurity of the Teſticles hath Nature provided a thing like a ſack or bag, called <hi>Scrotum,</hi> (we in Engliſh call it the Cods, and is viſible) it is divided by a line in the midſt, neither is the compoſition of it ſingle, for it hath a skin with its ſcarf-skin, and a <hi>Membrana Carnoſa,</hi> cloſe knit to the skin and wrinkled with it, which they call <hi>Darton,</hi> becauſe it can hardly be ſeparated from the skin: after this is the <hi>Elytroides,</hi> or proper Membrane which compaſſeth the Teſticles round, and this is a proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and is double as the Teſticles are.</p>
               <p>The external part is furniſhed with Muſcles which from their office are called <hi>Cremaſters</hi> or holders up; alſo from the fleſhy texture of ſtrings a red Membrane is formed, which Authors call <hi>Erythroides:</hi> the internal part which immediately compaſſeth about the Teſticles; is called <hi>Nervea;</hi> this being the proper tunicle of the Teſticles is ſometimes beſpread with fat, and ſo being, is a hindrance to the fruitfulneſs of the Seed. The Cremaſter Muſcles ariſe from the Ligaments of the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> under the tranſverſe Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> they hold up the weight of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles, and bring them to the Spermatick veſſels.</p>
               <p>We come now to the <hi>Vaſa deferentia,</hi> which are turned toward the back-ſide of the Bladder, afterwards by degrees dilated into certain Bladders in which the Seed being perfected is kept, they caſt out the Seed into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> by a ſpecial paſſage.</p>
               <p>The ejaculating veſſels are the laſt of the Spermaticks, which are called <hi>Proſtatae Glanduloſi,</hi> they are two fleſhy, hard, and firmly joyned bodies, compaſſed about with a ſtrong Membrane; it is in bigneſs, almoſt as big
<pb facs="tcp:40322:32"/>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40322:32"/> as a Walnut, and not unlike it in form, one ſide of it joyns to the <hi>Capſulae,</hi> from which it receives the Seed, the other ſide is joyned to the Neck of the Bladder, by many and ſmal paſſages, and when the Seed is troubleſome either by reaſon of its quantity or quallity, it caſteth it out into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Yard was principally ordained that it might caſt ſeed into the bottom of the Womb it conſiſts of a skin and a fleſhy Membrane, without any the leaſt fat, leaſt its motion ſhould be retarded, and the ſence of pleaſure in the act of copulation taken away by moiſture.</p>
               <p>It is properly made of two Nervous bodies with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> or veſſels through which the urine paſſeth, and the <hi>Glans;</hi> its body is long, thick, and of a ſoft ſubſtance, as though it were filled with Marrow; It hath a numerous company of Veins and Arteries, that ſo it might be furniſhed with heat and Spirit; It is moved by two Muſcles, and they are very ſhort, but thick and ſtrong, deduced from the Nervous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Coxendix.</hi> The beginning of the Bodies is from the inferior end of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> in the beginning they are disjoyned, afterwards in their progreſſe joyned by incloſure, and ſtretched to the <hi>Glans</hi> of the Yard.</p>
               <p>Under theſe is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> or channel, which is the paſſage both of urine and ſeed; it is compoſed of two Membranes, of which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal is thin and exquiſite in Sence, which cauſeth both pleaſure and pain; the external is thick endewed with tranſverſe <hi>Fibrae,</hi> both for motion and ſtrength ſake; the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> hath two Muſcles pretty long, yet ſlender, their original is from the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the right Gut, they terminate about the middle of the channel, and dilate it the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to expel the ſeed.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> is a fleſhy ſhutter, which ſhuts the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices of the <hi>Capſulae;</hi> this being either broken by unadviſed putting a <hi>Cattheter</hi> into the Bladder, or elſe gnawn aſunder by ſharpneſs of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cauſeth an uncurable <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> or running of the Reins.</p>
               <p>Famous veſſels are communicated to the Yard, Veins, and Arteries, from the Hypogaſtricks and <hi>Pudendae,</hi> whereof the one is diſtributed by the external Skin, the other by its Nervous Bodies; to theſe is added a double pair of Nerves from the <hi>os Sacrum,</hi> of which the one is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Skin, the other to the inner part of the Yard.</p>
               <p>The extremity of the Yard is called the <hi>Glans,</hi> of a fleſhy, ſoft, and Spongy ſubſtance, it is covered with a thin Membrane, that ſo it might be the ſofter to feeling, and the more exquiſite in Sence.</p>
               <p>A great part of it is covered with the common coverings of the Body, which is called <hi>Preputium,</hi> or the fore-skin, which is tied to the under-part of it by the Bridle; this fore-skin grows immoderately in young Children in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> that either for Religion ſake, or fear of other diſadvantages that might thence enſue they cut it off: ſuch as devote themſelves to Chaſtity, hang a Ring in that part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 7.</hi> Of the Inſtruments of Generation in Women.</head>
               <p>THE preparation of the Inſtruments of Generation, is no leſs in the Body of Women, than it is in the Body of Men, for there are thoſe by which the Seed is produced, and mixed with the Seed of Man being produced, and ſtirred up for the Generation of the Child; ſuch as regard the Seminal matter are the preparing veſſels, the Teſticles, the perfecting veſſels to which thoſe that caſt it out are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned The Womb is for the Conception of the Child.</p>
               <p>The preparing veſſels are two Veins, and as many Arteries as they are in Man, the right of the Veins proceeds from the Trunk of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> the left from the Emulgent. The original of the Arteries, is from the great Artery, and yet in the beginnings of thoſe, the work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is various, as it is in thoſe of Men: theſe veſſels joyn themſelves in their progreſſe, and yet ſtill remain within the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried partly to the Teſticles, partly to the <hi>Tubae</hi> of the Womb; its bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and Neck in which turning themſelves upwards by the Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick veſſels, they joyn by <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> and ſo they ſubminiſter matter not only to breed the Child, but alſo to nouriſh the parts.</p>
               <p>The Teſticles of Women are of a Glandulous ſubſtance, ſofter, and fuller of juyce then Mens are, in ſuch as are young, but leſſer, and harder in ſuch as are Ancient; they have only one ſingle Skin, but that is very ſtrong, and faſtened to the Ligaments of the Womb; about the bottom of it; they have an evident paſſage to the bottom of the Womb, though it be but ſhort, and another more ſlender, and not ſo eaſie to be ſeen, to the Neck of the Womb.</p>
               <p>There are neither <hi>Epididymides,</hi> nor yet <hi>Paraſtatae</hi> about the Teſticles of Women; for the Seed of Women needs not that exquiſite digeſtion that the Seed of Man doth, for the conſtitution of it is perfect, ſeeing it gives fit matter to make the Fruit.</p>
               <p>Neither yet doth Womens Teſticles ſtand only for ciphers neither, for they receive the matter from the preparing veſſels, and turn it into a watry milky ſubſtance; as is copiouſly found many times in their diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, eſpecially in ſuch as were young, and flouriſhing when they died: This Siminal juyce is carried from the Teſtciles, partly to the <hi>Tubae</hi> by ſmall paſſages like the <hi>Venae Lacteae,</hi> that there it may be perfected; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bottom, and Neck of the Womb, that it may keep them ſoft and moiſt, and as the Ancients think to ſtir the Women up to Venery; although this is only in hotter Natures, and ſuch whoſe paſſages are ſtreighter.</p>
               <p>To the bottom of the Womb which toucheth the Teſticles, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40322:33"/> of Spermatical moiſture, the Child being now conceived, is of farre Nobler uſe, for it bears up the Child, and keeps it from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of the Womb, and ſuſtains it, that the umbilicar veſſels which at firſt excel a Hair not much in bigneſs, be not broken by the ſhaking of the Mothers Body.</p>
               <p>The veſſels which keep the Seed, and caſt it out, are called <hi>Tubae,</hi> they are two round Bodies joyned to the bottom of the Womb on each ſide, they are called <hi>Tubae</hi> becauſe of their crooked bowing like a Trumpet, they are compoſed of two Membranes, which are common alſo to the Womb its ſelf, they have Veins &amp; Arteries from the Spermaticals, which are divided into ſmall branches, and Nerves from the ſame, which creep to the bottom of the Womb. Laſtly, as we ſhewed before, there is a Nervous paſſage inſerted into the bottom of the Womb, which is very ſeldom extended beyond the longitude of the <hi>Tubae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Womb are no <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> nor needs there, becauſe they are no divided Bodies, but joyned by the <hi>Tubae,</hi> and the Seminal moiſture paſſeth eaſily into the Womb, as you may eaſily perceive, if you do but cruſh one of them with your Finger. Obſtructions are freequent in the <hi>Tubae,</hi> as well as in the Womb; as alſo ſwellings, which out of queſtion are cauſes of Barrenneſs.</p>
               <p>Such Women as are fuitful have a twofold Spermatical matter, the one watry, which moiſtens and refreſheth the Womb, and Fruit in it, the other which is thick in the <hi>Tubae,</hi> which is mixed with the Seed of Man to make the Conception.</p>
               <p>To receive and preſerve both Seed and Fruit, is the Womb ordained, it is a part of the inferior Ventricle compoſed of two Membranes, that ſo it may be ſtretched wide when the Child is in it, and contracted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when it is Born; the exterior Membrane it hath from the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which is ſtrong, and out of danger of breaking, the interior which is propper to the Womb, is full of ſtrings and pores: between theſe Membranes a fleſhy contexture compaſſeth both the bottom and Neck of the Womb, which in the time of Conception like a Sponge drinks up the ſuperfluous moiſture, and is of a wonderful thickneſs when the Woman is with Child, but elſe very compact.</p>
               <p>Alſo it ſometimes happens, that when the Womb is narrow, and the Child great, or a Mole bred together with the Child, with mighty pain in Child-bearing, not only the thick, but alſo the thin ſubſtance of the Womb with its Membranes is broken, and the child breaks out with its Head, Feet, and Hands, whereſoever there is way made into the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> and ſometimes it falls down with its whole Body upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Bowels.</p>
               <p>The Womb hath a numerous company of veſſels, of which the Veins which accompany the Arteries on the upper part of it, deſcend from the veſſels which prepare the Seed; the middle and inferior parts are ſupplied from the Hypogaſtricks, which creeping upwards again, joyn themſelves by inoſculations to the fore mentioned veſſels; the Nerves which come to the ſuperior part of the Womb, are the extream bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the coſtal Nerves of the ſixt pair; the middle and inferior part is ſupplied from the <hi>Os Sacrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40322:34"/>
               <p>Not only age, but alſo the Sports of <hi>Venus</hi> and breeding Children alters the bigneſs of the Womb: the intertexed fleſh, and the plenty of Blood flowing thither, alters the cold and dry temper of the Membranes, which is ſo plentiful, that it adminiſter nouriſhment to the Child, and flows out monthly at other times: Its ſcituation is in the lower Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> where by the concourſe of the <hi>Os Sacrum, Ilium, Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endix,</hi> and <hi>Pubis,</hi> the <hi>Pelvis</hi> is framed, and for this intent it is larger in Women, than it is in Men, and gives way about the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> (though the Ligaments be very ſtrong) in the time of travail; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is joyned to the Bladder and the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> by the help of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> backwards with the right Gut</p>
               <p>Above it hath ſingular Ligaments and very ſtrong, but looſe, leaſt they ſhould be detrimented by the ſwelling of the Belly when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is with Child; the firſt of theſe which is in the ſides, ſeems to be a ſtretching out of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> it is Membranous, and broad, ſo that it bends the <hi>Tubae,</hi> Teſticles, and womb, to the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and is like the wing of a Bat, or Flitter mouſe; this being immoderatly looſned, or broken by violence, the bottom of the womb falls down upon the Neck, or elſe into one of the groynes.</p>
               <p>The other Ligament is round and Nervous, produced forwards from both ſides of the Bottom, and having pierced the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and joyned it ſelf to the Tendons of the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> it dilates its ſelf into a Membrane, joyns its ſelf to the <hi>Clyſteris,</hi> and looſly binds the bottom of the Womb to the foreparts; but indeed this round worm like Body is ſomething elſe beſides a bare Ligament, for if you diligently mark its ſtructure it conſiſts of a double Membrane, even as the Womb it ſelf doth: it takes its original at the bottom of the Womb, where the <hi>Tubae</hi> and Teſticles are: It is porous within, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end it is evidently hollow, and moiſt, with a watry Seed in ſuch Women as die a violent death, and therefore it is more probable that this Worm-like veſſel, when the mouth of the Womb is ſhut, gives paſſage to the Seminal Matter from the Teſticles to the Neck of the Womb, and caſts out excrements by thoſe paſſages from both Groyns.</p>
               <p>The office of the Womb is to receive the Seed, which is the principal of Generation, to keep and cheriſh it being received, and to bring forth the child into the world, all which it doth by its proper faculty: this will appear more cleerly if we conſider the parts of the womb di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
               <p>It is divided into the bottom, the Neck, the paſſage, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which is the Womans Privities. The uppermoſt part of the Womb is called the Bottom; it is thicker and harder in thoſe that are not great with child, the hand will eaſily graſp the bigneſs of it: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it reſembles the form of a Guord, being rather compreſſed than exactly round, if the Woman hath never been with Child; it hath a ſmall Cavity within, and but one, which is divided into the right and left by a very ſmall line; and yet in this ſecret lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhop, the Eternall Creator of all things begins and furniſheth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40322:34"/> the admirable Structure of Man, only by a few drops of Seed.</p>
               <p>Where the Womb begins to grow narrower, that is called the neck, and this uſually Authors confound with the paſſage: in this is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb, called internal, very ſmal; it is broadiſh in Virgins and Women which never had child, but round in ſuch as have; this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to receive the Seed, and ſhuts cloſe when it is received, and it ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to an extream wideneſs to give paſſage to the Child.</p>
               <p>To the bottom of the Neck is joyned the paſſage which is uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Neck of the Womb; it is a ſoft and looſe channel with unequal wrinkles, that ſo it may the better give intromiſſion to the Yard of Man, and extromiſſion to the Child; at the end of it, on the forepart, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the neck of the Bladder; behind it is ſtrongly bound to the <hi>Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> of the right Cut.</p>
               <p>The remainder of it is terminated in the Privities, in which the two lips are external, then the fleſhy and ſoft productions which Authors call <hi>Nymphae</hi> and <hi>Alae;</hi> by theſe it is defended from external injuries: between theſe <hi>Alae</hi> is the <hi>Clyſtoris,</hi> a ſmall round Body, made up of two Nervous portions, ſpongy within; it is endewed with two Muſcles on both ſides, they are very ſmall, but their office is the ſame with thoſe that dilates the paſſage in males; it hath plenty of veſſels of all ſorts, and is very exquiſite in ſence, that ſo by tickling it may cauſe pleaſure in the act of Copulation.</p>
               <p>Its unprofitable excrement (which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Endemium,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians, Malum</hi>) which ſticks out immoderately in young Girls, they cut off and ſcar: Under the <hi>Clyſtoris</hi> toward the internal part of the paſſage is the paſſage of Urine, which is ſhort in Women, and hath a ſmal <hi>Caruncle</hi> to defend it from cold.</p>
               <p>Such Virgins as keep themſelves from playing the wantons with themſelves, from the uſe of <hi>Venus</hi> and other external injuries, have a fleſhy skin that covers the paſſage, guarded with <hi>Caruncles,</hi> which Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents called <hi>Hymen;</hi> it hath a cleft in the middle through which the Terms monthly flow, the form of which quite ceaſeth after they have had to do with a Man and born Children; this as it is in Infants, and ſuch Virgins as are not Marriagable, we give to the view of ſuch as have chaſt minds in the fift and ſeventh Scheam of the next Table. In theſe, whatſoever is extended upwards by the ſides from the inferior angle of the Privities, contains the cleft, and is a laying open of the internal tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the paſſage, which is Membranous with many very ſmal Veins and Arteries, which in Virgins makes up that fleſhy circle like a flower; it is more fleſhy in ſome than it is in other ſome, ſo that it repreſents the form of two <hi>Caruncles:</hi> It is commonly thin, and the weaker by reaſon of the defluxions of humors, ſo that it is broken without much ado. Two fleſhy Productions like mirtle Leaves are neer this skin, or elſe like Almonds, which make the paſſage the narrower in Virgins, by which, the <hi>Caruncle</hi> which compaſſeth about the paſſage of the Urine is ſeen.</p>
               <p>Theſe things by the Law of Nature being thus conſtituted, Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40322:35"/> careful for the defence of Virginity, ſometimes frames another thin skin from the inferior angle of the Privities and the ſides, which is ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched croſs the chink like a zone, neither gives it any paſſage ſave only neer the paſſage of Urine, where it is looſe and ſevered from the parts of the Privities: This, men very ſkilful in Anatomy, have formerly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the <hi>Hymen;</hi> this is but in few, and many Midwives tear it away for an unprofitable excrement: See its form in the ſixt Figure of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Table.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi> Of the Fruit in the Womb.</head>
               <p>TO the Body of the Mother we adjoyn the contemplation of the fruit in the Womb, becauſe it is a part of it though temporary, as not only the community of ſubſtance and nouriſhment, but alſo the nexure of the Secundine and Umbilicar veſſels to the Womb witneſſeth; this Fruit we conſider as genuine, and nouriſhed by the Womb, and as being fitting to breath the air, it breaks out from that narrow incloſure.</p>
               <p>The ſmall Body of the <hi>Embrion</hi> is formed by the vital vertue of the Seed of the Man, from which office it is called <hi>Plaſtica;</hi> of which, by the appointment of God himſelf, by his infinite wiſdom, goodneſs and power, he hath left not only obſcure foot-ſteps, but alſo cleer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to this, the heat of the Seed and Nouriſhment from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adminiſters: the <hi>Compendium</hi> that doth this great work is very ſmall, not exceeding the bigneſs of a great Emmet; from which, that is firſt formed, without which life cannot be preſerved, to wit, the Heart, and from it the veins and arteries as from their <hi>Baſis,</hi> afterwards the Liver, and then other parts which come firſt into uſe.</p>
               <p>That the Heart is firſt formed before any other part your eyes will witneſs, if you dilligently contemplate the framing of the <hi>Embrion</hi> in Eggs; and although the Heart be very little and altogether white, yet
<pb facs="tcp:40322:37"/>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40322:37"/> by reaſon of the blood contained in each Ventricle, it hath a tranſparent redneſs to be diſtinguiſhed from the other parts: The motion of the Heart helps and confirms this, for ſo ſoon as any blood is to be ſeen in the Veins of the <hi>Embrion,</hi> the Heart being full of blood moves with a ſwift, yet ordinary pulſe; ſo often as it is dilated it receives blood into its Ventricles; ſo often as it is compreſſed, it caſts it out, and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Heart whilſt it is white, though ſomething increaſed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it muſt firſt be formed by reaſon of its ſingular plenty of heat, which no other part of the Body is equally endewed with. Laſtly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity requires its firſt formation, that ſo by its motion the vital Spirit may be ſtirred up, increaſed and diſtributed to the Body.</p>
               <p>The matter of which the firſt forming ſiſteme of the Body is produced is the Seminal ſubſtance in the Body of the Mother, which paſſing from the <hi>Tubae</hi> to the bottom of the womb, to which the Seed of the Man ads heat and Spirit, and to the increaſe and maintaining of it is the Blood of the Mother required; this comes not at all to that firſt mixture from the Seed, neither doth it make any <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> but after an interval of time, the Umbilicar veſſels and Heart being framed it is drawn and takes its redneſs with the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>Of the parts procreated, ſome loſe their uſe, others retain it ſo long as life laſteth; ſuch as loſe their uſe are, the Navil and its Veſſels, the the Membranes which compaſs the Child in the womb, and the <hi>Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> the uſe of theſe ceaſeth ſo ſoon as the Child is brought forth to light.</p>
               <p>The Navil is a Membranous ducture, by which the Vein and Arteries ariſe from the child to the Mothers Womb; both this and the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine wants Nerves becauſe they have no use of ſence: It is of a famous length, even in the very beginning of the Formation, although the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Embrion</hi> at beginning be no bigger than a great Emmit, or a ſmall Bee; but when the Fruit is ready for extramiſſion, the Navil-ſtring is three ſpans long, and as thick as ones finger, both for the ſtrength of the Veſſels, the perfecting of the blood by its long paſſage, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious motion of the Child, and the eaſier drawing out the Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine; it hath no diſtinct nodes, yet is it wreathed and unequal, for the eaſier bowing of the included veſſels.</p>
               <p>The riſe of the Navil, is from the middle of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> that the inclination of the Head and Breaſt of the Child might be the readier to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mouth of the Womb; at the biginning of the <hi>Embrion</hi> it ſwims in the Liquor of the <hi>Amnios,</hi> but when it is more perfected it is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed for the moſt part above the Breaſt, and produced backwards by the hinder part of the Head to the Fore-head, and joyned to the womb by Membranes and the contained Veſſels.</p>
               <p>The Veſſels contained in the Navil, are, one vein and two arteries; the vein is largeſt, and takes its Original from the Foundation of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na porta</hi> within the Liver, therefore it deſcends by the Arteries of the Liver to the Navil, and being divided into very many branches above the <hi>Chorion,</hi> it joyns its ſelf to the Womb, and carries Blood for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Infant: The Umbilicar Arteries take their Original from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40322:38"/> the Iliack branches of the great Artery, from w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> place being ſtretched upwards by the ſides of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachos,</hi> they enter the Navil, and are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldly diſtributed above the <hi>Corion</hi> with the Veins, they carry vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and communicates it to the Child.</p>
               <p>It is farre enough off from the truth that theſe veſſels paſſe to the Child from the Mothers womb, and the Membranes adjacent, for in the young ones of Birds, it is eaſie to be ſeen that Nature deduceth the Veins and Arteries, from the Fruit it ſelf incloſed in its Secundines, and by degrees divideth them into leſſer branches; It doth the like in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, whoſe roots come not from the Earth to the Plants, but the Plants ſend them to the Earth for nouriſhment, and this is abundantly proved in Bulbous roots that grow out of the Earth; neither comes this opinion neer the truth, that the Arteries &amp; umbilicar vein are framed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heart and Liver, for neither Heart nor Liver is made of Blood, but of Seed, and the whole Syſteme of the Body is made before any veſſels paſſe from it; for before the Bowels are formed, there is no need of veſſels: as the Conception of living Crearures, and the Seeds of Plants evidently demonſtrates.</p>
               <p>The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus</hi> is added to the Umbilicar veſſels, being a Membranous Body, round and porous within, ariſing from the Baſis of the Bladder, and attenuated towards the Navil, it delivers the Urine from the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the <hi>Amnios,</hi> and yet this ſeems doubtful to theſe who behold the ſolidity of this veſſel, the ſmalneſs of its pore, and the obſcurity of its paſſage out by the Navil; but ſo ſoon as the Infant is born, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the Navil ſtring is left to the Body after it is cut off, its former uſe ceaſing, is turned into a Ligament.</p>
               <p>The Membranes which compaſs about the Child in the womb, are two, of which, that which is next the Body of it is called <hi>Amnios,</hi> being ſoft, light, and cleer, gently joyned to the <hi>Chorion</hi> where the <hi>Placenta</hi> is; from the very beginning of the Conception, it contains a watry Liquor, which defends the tender Limbs of the <hi>Embrion</hi> in the violent motions of the Mother,; and in the labour of the Mother the Membranes being broken, it mollifies the paſſages, and gives the eaſier extramiſſion to the Child: that this is gathered together between the Membranes, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios,</hi> and <hi>Chorios,</hi> the connexion of the Tunicles, and dilligent obſervation denies; neither can there come any detriment to the Child, from the ſharpneſs of this humor, ſeeing the <hi>Cuticula</hi> eaſily defends it.</p>
               <p>The other Membrane they call <hi>Chorion,</hi> and it compaſſeth the whole Child round, on the outſide of the <hi>Amnios,</hi> and is the thicker of the two by odds, it is ſmooth on the inſide, and is furniſhed with abundance of the Umbilicar Veins and Arteries; In which place (the Child encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) the Liver or <hi>Placenta</hi> of the womb ariſeth; in Figure it is a ſoft and Spongy peice of fleſh, and hath many branches of the Umbilicar veſſels, both to cheriſh its heat, and nouriſh its ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>To theſe they add the <hi>Allantoes,</hi> or Skin in which the Urine is kept, although this appears in the Anatomy of Bruites, rather than of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>To theſe Membranes Ancient Authors defend and prove mightily,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40322:38"/> and as mightily diſagree about certain veſſels called <hi>Acetabula</hi> and <hi>Cotyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones,</hi> which ſome ſay are, ſome ſay are not joyned, ſome hold them to be the mouths of the veſſels ſwelled with Blood, other pieces of fleſh between the <hi>Chorion</hi> and the Womb, which prop up the Umbilicar veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and receive the Blood when it flows too faſt to the Child, which is conſpicuous in the Wombs of Sheep, and the like Creatures.</p>
               <p>If we ſearch out what anſwers to this in women, you muſt look to <hi>Placenta</hi> before deſcribed, which being hollow on that part next the <hi>Chorion,</hi> convex on that part which is next the womb, repreſents the ſame form, only it is far bigger, and by the ſoftneſs of its ſubſtance, and multitude of its veſſels, performs the ſame office: Theſe are the parts of the Child which are uſeleſs after Birth, and are called the After-birth or Secundine.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Body which continues ſtill in office, the Child being born, are the ſame which are in the Ventricles, the unlikeneſs of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the child in the womb, to a mans of age, is here to be ſpoken off, the Ventricle of the Child in the womb, though it be contracted, yet is it never Empty, but alwaies white and covered over with the Liver. The Guts are ſeven times as long as the Body, and the Gut called <hi>Caecum</hi> is filled with excrements; the excrements of the ſmall Guts are Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and yellow, thoſe in the great Guts ſolid and hard, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Meconium:</hi> The Liver appears great, and ſtretched out even to the left <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> the ſubſtance of it before it grows red, may be ſeen full of purple Veins, and the Gall under it appears yellow, and ſwelled: The Sweet-bread is large, and by its bright colour evidently ſhew the diduction of Chyle, and yet it ſhews it more cleerly after the Child is born, whilſt it ſucks. The ſecond Table of this Chapter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents you with its delineaments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Glandula</hi> of the Kidneyes are of a wonderful bigneſs, and lye not in the Reins, as they do in such as are grown up, but lye upon them, and embrace the ſuperior part of them; the reins themſelves are great, and have very many <hi>Glandulae;</hi> the Ureters are wide, and the Bladder full of Urine; the bottom of the womb in young Wenches is compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the <hi>Tubae</hi> ſtretched out, the Teſticles great, al which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Figure in the forementioned Table Specifies.</p>
               <p>The Bowels of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> which are allotted, for publique digeſtion, do not want private digeſtion, but manifeſtly operate for the common profit of the Infant; for that the Stomach makes Chyle, is manifeſt by the matter contained in it, and by the various excrements in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Guts: Although the Sence of Man cannot yet perceive by what paſſages the ſubſtance to be converted into <hi>Chyle,</hi> comes to the Stomach: The fancies of the Ancients that the Child ſucked in at its mouth, being exploded for many difficulties, yet is it agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that as in Men, the Liver and Spleen receive whatſoever is to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Blood, ſo whilſt the Fruit is nouriſhed in the womb, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the throat being denied, the Stomach ſhould draw that from the Liver and Spleen which it digeſteth, and turneth into <hi>Chyle;</hi> that the Liver makes Blood in the Fruit is cleer, by the ſeparation of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40322:39"/> Chollerick and watry excrement, for although the Blood of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by which the Embrion is nouriſhed be pure, yet is it unlike to the temperature of the Fruit, and therefore ſtands in need of another ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and change.</p>
               <p>About the Breaſt, the Veins are very full of Blood; but the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing in the Heart is, there is a large paſſage out of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> or an anaſtomoſis, defended with a Membrane; alſo a ſmall channel out of the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> into the great Artery, ſo that the Blood may readily paſſe from the right ventricle of the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the left, theſe paſſages as age comes, Nature ſtops up by degrees, unleſs ſome great obſtructions of Flegm (as ſomtimes happens) ſtop up the vulgar paſſages: the Heart it ſelf is great, and its ears and veſſels large, the Lungues ſeem Bloody, neither have they as yet obtained their rariety, becauſe of their reſt, and yet their Birth being neer, and the place they move in growing looſe; the Lungues grow lighter, and gently draw in ſome air, and this is cleer, becauſe ſometimes a ſound is heard of the Fruit, not only in Bruits, but alſo in Women.</p>
               <p>The Heart moves in the <hi>Embrion</hi> ſo ſoon as the Mothers Blood flows to it, which it perfects within its Ventricles, and endews it with vital Spirit, that ſo it may preſerve and ſtir up the faculties of other parts, the parts of the Ears of the Heart is diſtinct in reſpect of time from other parts, for they firſt of all compel the Blood into the Heart by compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves, then by dilating themſelves draw Blood again.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 9.</hi> Of the external parts of the Breaſt.</head>
               <p>THe lower Ventricle, and the parts in and about it being already ſpoken of, the middle ventricle follows, which is called <hi>Thorax,</hi> in Engliſh the Breaſt, which is round about circumſcribed with the <hi>Pleura;</hi> In which we will conſider, Firſt, the external parts, then the vitals themſelves.</p>
               <p>To the external parts of the Breaſt, belong the common coverings of the Body, of which we have ſpoken already; alſo the Pectoral Muſcle, the <hi>Serratus Anticus</hi> both greater and leſſer, and of Bones, the <hi>Claviculae</hi> and <hi>Scapulae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pectoral Muſcle is ſo called, becauſe it is ſpread abroad the Breaſt and much encreaſeth its bigneſs; its original is from the middle <hi>Clavicula,</hi> the <hi>Sternum,</hi> the Cartilages of the ſixt, ſeventh, and eight Ribs, it hath a ſhort, yet ſtrong Tendon inſerted into the Bone of the Shoulder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Muſcles <hi>Deltois</hi> and <hi>Biceps,</hi> and holds it ſtoutly to the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The Muſcle called the greater <hi>Serratus anticus,</hi> ariſeth obliquely to the Baſis of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> from eight Ribs, five of the true ones, and three of the Baſtard ones, and draws it down forwards. The leſſer <hi>Serratus anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> lies hid under the Pectoral, and proceeds from the ſecond, third, fourth and fift Ribs, and paſſeth to the proceſs of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> called <hi>Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois,</hi> or Beak-like, which moves the <hi>Scapula</hi> obliquely forwards; of the <hi>Clavicula</hi> and <hi>Scapula</hi> becauſe they belong eſpecially to the Shoulder, ſhall be treated of in the ſeventeenth Chapter.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40322:43"/>
               <p>And yet properly to the <hi>Thorax</hi> belong the Breaſts, the Bones the Breaſt is compoſed of, the intercoſtal Muſcles, the <hi>Pleura,</hi> the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> and the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The office of the Breaſts in Women is to breed Milk, if you conſider them in Women that give ſuck; they conſiſt of very many ſmall glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Bodies, diverſe in bigneſs, that they may not only receive the Blood from the ſmall Veſſels, but alſo the vapors and milky moiſture, which is largely diſtributed to them from the Stomach and Sweet-bread: by inſtinct of Nature, theſe ſmall Bodies are contained together with a Membrane with diverſe cavities which contain milk, the foundation of which remain when the milk is gone; they have much fat, which ſerves not only to ad comlineſs to them, but alſo to conſerve vital heat in them.</p>
               <p>They receive two veins, one derived from the axilliar branch w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed by the external part of the Breaſt; the other is called <hi>Mammaria</hi> and is diſtributed by the internal part from the ſubclavian branch of the <hi>Vena Cava:</hi> they have alſo ſo many Arteries as veins ariſing from the ſame roots, namely from the Subclavian branch of the great Arterie, and the axilliar, which are diſtributed in the ſame manner to give them vital heat; they have Nerves from the fourth Branch of the Marrow of the Back.</p>
               <p>In the middeſt of the Breaſts are the Nepples, round and rare, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with a Membrane from the glandulous Bodies; they have a thin skin full of holes, and ſtick out, that the Child may the better ſuck; round about them is a red circle like a <hi>Halo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The bigneſs of the Breaſts is varied, not only by years and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their office, but alſo by the humors that flow thither, and the diverſity of the climate: In the Women in <hi>Europe,</hi> they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but in the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Women they are ſo long that they can give their Children ſuck over their ſhoulders: They are in number two, that ſo the woman may give two children ſuck; in temperament they are hot and moiſt, and are placed in the middeſt of the Breaſt, that ſo they may be the neerer to the Fountain of Vital Heat, and the readier to give the Child ſuck as the Mother carries it in her arms.</p>
               <p>Their proper action is the Generation of Milk, although it be not yet very cleer by what waies it is done, becauſe in Carkaſſes the paſſages are hid; as the paſſage of <hi>Chyle</hi> is in the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> and of Seed from the Teſticles to the <hi>Paraſtatae,</hi> and from the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like paſſages in living Creatures, and yet the Diſſection of living Creatures that give ſuck, gives ſome light to it.</p>
               <p>For Bones, The Breaſt is defended with the <hi>Sternum</hi> before, on the ſides with the Ribs, and behind with the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bones of the <hi>Sternum</hi> is ſpongy and red, uſually divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts, although in age it grow into one Fone; the firſt and largeſt of them, reſembles the knob of a Cup, the other two are joyned to them by Cartilages; it hath a Cartilaginous apendix, which by reaſon of its form is called <hi>Mucronata;</hi> it is the defence of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40322:43"/> ſometimes gives paſſage to the Mammary Vein and Artery; this alſo in old age grows Bony, ſometimes it ſtick inwards and ſometims outwards, and that no ſmall prejudice to the Stomach; ſometimes it ſticks out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Navil as long as ones finger, and is ſtiff, and then it wonderfully hinders both the diſtribution of the <hi>Chyle</hi> by compreſſing the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and alſo the bowing of the Body forwards.</p>
               <p>The Ribs are partly Bony as on the Back and Sides, partly Cartiagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as on the fore part where they are joyned to the <hi>Sternum;</hi> the one encreaſeth the ſtrength, the other makes the motion of the Breaſt the eaſier, and the Breaſt it ſelf the ſafer from external injuries; they are in number on each ſide twelve, of which, the ſeven ſuperior are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led True, the other inferior, Baſterd Ribs, not becauſe they are ſhorter but becauſe they end not in the <hi>Sternum</hi> with Cartilages, for indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Bodies is ſpurious or falſe, but all formed by the hand of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
               <p>They have a hollowneſs in the inferior part through which they give ſafe paſſage to the Veins, Arteries, and intercoſtal Nerves; all the Ribs are bowed in a circular form, that ſo they may give convenient large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Breaſt; externally they are ſomewhat uneven, but internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where they are joyned to the <hi>Pleura</hi> they are very ſmooth, on the Back they are received by the holes of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> ſome of them have a ſingle, ſome a double knob; they are bound together with firm Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and are joyned to the <hi>Sternum</hi> before by Cartilages, and alſo they ſtick too on another, yet is not their nexure ſo firm, but external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries often looſeth it, and in the Dropſie <hi>Aſcites</hi> the water often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Cartilages of the inferior Ribs.</p>
               <p>As many Ribs as there are, ſo many <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are there to receive them, and twelve pair of Nerves from the Marrow of the Back proceed from them, the formation of <hi>Vertebrae</hi> is the ſame with thoſe of the Loyns, ſave only the Bones are more depreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles of the Breaſt which cauſe the motion of it, are, the <hi>Subclavia,</hi> the triangular Muſcle, the Intercoſtals, and the Dorſals; of the Subclavian Muſcles is but one pair only, taking its beginning from the inferior part of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> from whence it paſſeth to the firſt Rib and its ſuperiour part, which it moveth upwards and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The Triangular Muſcles are produced from the internal part of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and ſtick to the Cartilages of the ſuperiour Ribs, which whilſt they contract, the Heart alſo moving it ſelf by their ſoftneſs, they keep it from being hurt by the <hi>Sternum.</hi> The Intercoſtal Muſcles on both ſides, are noted to be twenty two pair, of which, eleven are external, and as many internal, diſtinguiſhing themſelves by the obliquity of their ſtrings: The external Muſcles proceed from the inferior part of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Ribs, and end in the ſuperior part of the inferior Rib, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by drawing the Ribs, they further inſpiration: The internal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Muſcle proceed from the ſuperior part of the inferior Rib, and end in the inferior part of the ſuperior, and by withdrawing the Ribs help the expiration; they receive veins from the Vein without a fellow, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40322:44"/> the ſuperior intercoſtal, Arteries from the ſuperior and inferior inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtals, Nerves from the Marrow of the back, from the eleven pair on each ſide, to which the internal branches of the ſixt pair joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>As for the Dorſal Muſcles, though they pertain to the Breaſt, yet are they better found out by diſſection when the Carkaſs is turned over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Belly, therefore we ſhal ſpeak of them in the following Chapter, yet to the containing parts of the Breaſt are to the referred: The <hi>Pleura, Mediaſtinum,</hi> and <hi>Diaphragma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pleura</hi> is a Membrane girding the ribs, and their Muſeles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing all the internal parts of the Breaſt: It hath Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, from the intercoſtal branches, and about the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the back it is manifeſtly double, it is ſtrong every where, ſmooth next the Lungues, and firmly knit to the joynts of the back. The plenty of veſſels often cauſeth an inflamation in it, and corruption is often gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there, and remains ſometimes between the ſides of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> ſometimes neer the Lungues, and ſometimes in the Cavity of the Breaſt, the Lungues being ſafe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> although it may be reckoned amongſt the internal parts of the Breaſt, yet ſeeing it appears to be only a continuation of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> we will deſcribe them together. It is a double Membrane ſtretched from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt to the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both Breaſt and Lungues, to the right and left part, bearing up both the Heart and <hi>Pericardium:</hi> It hath a proper Vein of its own, which is called <hi>Mediaſtina,</hi> which ariſeth from the ſubclavian branch of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Cava,</hi> and it hath other ſmal branches from the Mammaries and Vein without a Mate; it hath Arteries from the Mammaries, and Nerves from the ſixt pair, eſpecially from its left recurrent branch.</p>
               <p>The Largeneſs of the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> equals the longitude and depth of the Breaſt, its duplication under the <hi>Sternum,</hi> is evident, with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable interval bteween, in which ſometimes a conflux of vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and ſometimes wind is gathered, and in deep Wounds, when the vitals themſelves are not hurt, they admit of a ſpeedy and eaſie cure: It is indifferent firm in reſpect of ſtrength, and ſoft towards the Lungues, and ſometimes hath fat on it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diaphragma</hi> follow, otherwiſe called <hi>Septum Tranſverſum,</hi> which is placed between the Breaſt and the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and gives bounds to both Cavities, and concurs with the external coſtal Muſcles to help inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is framed of a double ſubſtance, for it hath a Muſculous fleſh and a double Membrane, the ſuperior of which it hath from the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and the inferior from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and by their concourſe they fill up that part of it which wanteth fleſh; it hath Veins and Arteries from the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and great Artery, which are joyned to it; It hath famous Nerves above from the plexure of the Nerves of the Neck, from the greater deſcending branch of the fifth pair, and this cauſeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent between the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the Head and Muſcles of the Lips.</p>
               <p>On the right ſide the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and on the left ſide the <hi>Gula</hi> paſſeth through the <hi>Diaphragma:</hi> It is ſtretched out, firſt of all into two fleſhy;
<pb facs="tcp:40322:46"/>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40322:46"/> Secondly, into two tendinous proceſſes, by which the great Artery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, the reſt of its form is almoſt circular, joyned to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and the baſtard ribs: In the middle where it hath a Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous centre, it is firmly joyned to the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and ſometimes it knits to it ſelf the lobes of the Lungues which lye upon it, ſometimes it hath Apoſthumes in it, as big as ones fiſt, which by reaſon of their weight cauſe a moſt extream Difficulty of breathing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 10.</hi> Of the Heart and Lungues.</head>
               <p>THE Heart and Lungues occupy the Cavity of the Breaſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> Wind-pipe, and common veſſels, have alſo their proper places in it.</p>
               <p>Before we can behold the Heart, we muſt remove the <hi>Pericardium</hi> by which the Heart is wrapped round: It is of a Membranous ſubſtance, and not only contains the Heart in its proper place, but alſo defends it from injuries, neither is this Tunicle ſingle, but is obſerved to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the ſame with the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> inwardly to proceed from the veſſels produced from the Heart: It hath ſmal Veins from the Phrenical, its Arteries are are ſcarce conſpicuous: It hath Nerves from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and internal branch of the ſixt pair, and its <hi>Recurrens;</hi> although the right branch of thoſe Nerves which are carried to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> paſſe by the out ſide of it, it is very neer the Heart, only there is that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between the Heart and it, which is commodious for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pulſation of the Heart; about the Baſis of the Heart where it is joyned to the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> it gives paſſage to the Veins and Arteries; It contains in it a thin Liquor, gathered of reſolved vapors, whereby the drineſs, and ſuddain heavineſs of the Heart is allaied.</p>
               <p>The Heart it ſelf, which is the Prince of all the Bowels, and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40322:47"/> Fountain of vital heat and Spirit, by whoſe flouriſhing the Creature flouriſheth, and by whoſe languiſhing it languiſheth, and by whoſe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it dies. I call it the Fountain not of that primoginial heat produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſubſtance of the Seed, but of the influential heat; which is taken from nouriſhment, or drawn by Blood; It conſiſts of a thick and compact ſubſtance, that it may not only keep that hot and vital Spirit to its ſelf, but alſo communicate to the whole Body by the Arteries: It hath a proper Membrane of its own, which is very thin, and yet very ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The coronal Vein and Artery are diſtributed about the exterior part of it, the Vein from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which by a Moon-like ſhutter ſtops the Blood running back; the Artery from the great Artery, which gives his branches moſt eſpecially to the left ſide of the Heart, it hath Nerves from the next branches of the ſixt pair, which are diſtributed to the fleſhy ſubſtance of the Heart, and are ſcarce obſervable to any, of thoſe which come to the <hi>Pericardium</hi> we have ſpoken before, of which, that which proceeds from the left <hi>Recurrens</hi> gives a branch to the Baſis of the Heart, neither can the Heart want theſe, for its motion ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it moves before the animal faculty gives either Sence or motion: It hath very many Spermatical parts, according to the receſs of its Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, like Nerves in form, but larger, and if you dilligently view them in a Diſſection, you ſhall find they have a pore within. The greater part of the Heart is covered with fat, which preſerves it from conſuming, which ſometimes is ſo copious, that the blind South-ſayers that judged by the entrails of beaſts, ſaid they had no Hearts, becauſe they could not ſee them for fat.</p>
               <p>There hang appendices neer the Baſis of the Heart, on each ſide, and by reaſon of their likeneſs they call Eears, and their ſubſtance is almoſt like; Save only that the left is a little more ſolid, they are both of them hollow, and full of Nervous ſtrings; yet the Heart being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Syſtole,</hi> it may receive the Blood flowing into it, and return it back again; the bigneſs of the Heart in Man is famous, though various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to age and Temperament.</p>
               <p>It is divided into the Baſis, or broadeſt part, and the top; which is the narroweſt, and ends in a poynt: It hath two Ventricles, the right, and the left, the right is the thinner, but the larger, diſtinguiſhed by a thin and fleſhy portition, which ſometimes being doubled, makes a third.</p>
               <p>From the right Ventricle, the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> takes its original, whoſe beginning is ſtrong, being Membranous with ſhutters at the end, that it may adminiſter Blood to the Heart to perfect. I call it a veſſel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contains a liquid ſubſtance, to be diſtributed to all the parts of the Body, and a Membranous veſſel, on it conſiſts of its own proper Tunicle, which is ſingle and ſoft, that it may the better draw the blood by inoſculations, and yet for ſafeguard in its progreſſe, where it lies more open; it is covered with the covering of the adjacent parts.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Provident Creator hath added ſhutters to it, to wit, very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40322:47"/> thin Membranes, in form like a half Moon, which looks towards the beginnings of the Veins, which ſet a moderation to the preternatural motion of the Blood, out of the great Veins into the leſs; theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may be ſeen in the Meſenterick, Splenical emulgent <hi>Azy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and jugular Veins, yet are they more freequent in the Veins of the Limbs, which we ſhall treat of in the laſt Chapter; from theſe the three ſhutters about the mouth of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> differ a little in form, and from their form Authors call them <hi>Tricuſpides;</hi> theſe are joyned to the Nervous ſtrings of the Heart, and withſtand the regreſſe of the Blood into the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vena Cava</hi> ariſing up above the Heart produceth the <hi>Azygus,</hi> or Vein without a fellow, the branches of which, are commonly diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the inferior Ribs; the inferior portion of this, deſcending neer the fleſhy portion of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> is inſerted again on the left to the Emulgent, on the right ſide to the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and to the firſt of the Loyns, the Inſtitution of Nature being various herein, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Azygus</hi> being let paſſe, produceth a famous Vein from both Subclavian branches of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> neer the Mammaries, which is ſtretched out all along the Breaſt, even to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> from which both all the intercoſtal Veins, and the Lumbals proceed: when the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Cava</hi> arives at the Throat, it is divided into two large branches, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Subclavian, from which the ſuperior intercoſtal, the internal Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, the <hi>Mediaſtina,</hi> the cervical, and Vein called <hi>Muſcula</hi> ariſe; above, the interior and exterior jugular, and the ſuperior <hi>Muſcula</hi> are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>Alſo from the right Ventricle of the Heart ariſeth a vein, which for its double Tunicle is called <hi>Arterioſa,</hi> which being diſtributed both to the right, and left part of the Lungues, by great branches adminiſters Blood freely to them; about the bnginning of it are three Membranous ſhutters, very conſpicuous, looking outwards, called <hi>Sigmoides</hi> from their form, they ſhut in the Blood which flows back from the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lungues, but is indeed an Artery, not a Vein, for beſides the ſubſtance of an Artery which it hath, it hath alſo pulſation as well as the reſt of the Arteries, as the Diſſection of Creatures alive ſhews, and it carries Blood already attenuated by the Heart.</p>
               <p>The left Ventricle of the Heart, is ſmaller than the right, but more fleſhy, whereby it ſtirs up the Spirit in the received Blood, both by its ſelf, and by its ſtronger motion, and this is called vital.</p>
               <p>The great Artery called <hi>Aorta,</hi> takes its beginning from this; a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous veſſel in continual pulſation while life remains, of a ſhining co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and diſtributes the Blood being abſolutely perfected in the Heart, to the whole Body: Its ſubſtance is more Nervous than a vein, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a double Tunicle, of which, the internal is the thicker, and is ſometimes ſtiffe in old age, ſo that in, and neer the Heart it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a Bony circle; the external is thin, to which the Membranes of the adjoyning parts ad ſtrength.</p>
               <p>At its beginning are three ſhutters conſpicuous, and are called <hi>Lunar</hi> from their Figure, and keep the Blood from returning back again into
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40322:48"/> the Heart, neither is there any other ſhutters in all its Progreſs, for the ſtrength of the internal tunicle doth not eaſily ſuffer dilation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no delay in the paſſage of blood in it: Its blood is hotter, fuller of ſpirits, and of a brighter colour, and ſeeing the diſtribution of it by pulſe is continual, the heart muſt needs be continually ſupplied by the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> to fill its Ventricles, and this cauſeth a perpetual motion of Blood to the Heart, more or leſs; for the very ſame end Nature hath placed the veins as companions to the arteries, that they might readily receive what might be adminiſtred to the emptying of the Heart, for the exact knowledg of which our age is beholding to <hi>William Harvey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deſcending Trunk of the great Artery as it diſtributes the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior intercoſtal Arteries, the Phrenical and others which we diſcourſed of when we treated of the <hi>Abdomen;</hi> ſo paſſing out of the Heart it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two large ſubclavian branches, from which, before they paſs out of the Breaſt, ariſeth below, the ſuperior intercoſtal Artery, and a little higher the interior Mammary, the Vertebral and Cervical; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the great Artery produceth the <hi>Carotides</hi> on both ſides, the internal and external branch of which riſe up to the head.</p>
               <p>Neer to thoſe Veſſels about the Throat are the <hi>Thymus,</hi> a ſoft and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy piece of fleſh, which underproppeth them for their ſafe-guard.</p>
               <p>From the left Ventricle of the Heart, proceeds an Artery which the Ancients call <hi>Venoſa</hi> becauſe it hath but one Tunicle and dividing its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it is carried to the right and left region of the Lungues, taking the Blood mixed with Air to its ſelf, and carrying it to the left Ventricle of the Heart. It hath two ſhutters to ſtay the blood from flowing back from the Heart into it, which Authors call <hi>Mitrae</hi> becauſe they are like a Cardinals Cap; but this veſſel is rather to be called a Vein than an Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe its ſubſtance is the ſame with the Veins, neither hath it pulſe as Arteries have, it carries the Blood tempered with Air to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Between the Ventricles of the Heart is a partition called <hi>Septum,</hi> which is hollowiſh toward the left ſide, but gibbous towards the right, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very many ſmall holes; many paſſages come to this ſame <hi>Septum,</hi> of a various bigneſs from the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and the <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> which cloath the Baſis of the Ventricles, and adminiſter neceſſary Blood unto them.</p>
               <p>In temperature the Heart is without doubt the hotteſt of all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels; its Baſis is in the middeſt of the Breaſt, only the top of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines towards the left ſide as it moves; it is joyned to the next parts by its Veſſels, and by the <hi>Pericardium</hi> to the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its proper action is to perfect the Blood, and to give it heat and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit, and motion which is called <hi>Pulſe;</hi> this is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole,</hi> when the Heart drawing its ſelf together expels the Blood, and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi> when it extends its ſelf to receive it.</p>
               <p>According to the opinion of the Ancients, only the Heart conſumes not in laſting diſeaſes, and yet it often happens that it doth pine by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hot diſtempers; ſometimes a glandulous ſubſtance makes its
<pb facs="tcp:40322:50"/>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40322:50"/> paſſages ſtraight, and ſometimes they are filled with Flegm, whereby the ſick loſeth his life leiſurely and by degrees.</p>
               <p>On both ſides of the Heart are the Lungues, which are diſſimilar parts of the middle Ventricle and by drawing in the cold air, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back the fuliginous vapors they cool the vital heat, therefore that they may every where be filled and diſtended, they are compoſed of a ſoft ſubſtance rare and ſubtil, and covered with a porous Membrane; they receive very large veſſels, the Arterial vein from the right, and the Venal artery from the left Ventricle of the Heart: alſo the wind-pipe which we ſhall diſcourſe of in the next Chapter, it hath ſmall Nerves from the external deſcending branch of the ſixt pair, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed about the exterior Tunicle, and the hinder parts of it, where they are joyned to the branches of the Wind-pipe, not only for their ſafety, but alſo for the means of its ſence, that it may not be troubleſom to their motion.</p>
               <p>The Lungues being ſwelled by inſpiration of air, fill the Breaſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> being between they are divided into the right and left part, both which for the more ſafeguard is divided into the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and inferior lobe; outwardly, the Lobes reſemble an Ox hoof; inwardly they are hollowiſh, and gently imbrace the Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often communicate their vices to it, although if putrified matter lie in the gibbous part without any evident rottenneſs, or feaveriſh bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the ſtrength of the Heart and the vigor of the Natural functions remains long untouched.</p>
               <p>They are judged to be in temperature hot and dry, by reaſon of the plenty of ſpirits, and ſcarcity of nouriſhment although the moiſture that alwaies flow to them and the frequent acceſs of cold Air ſeems to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure both, they are thicker in Children, and grow rare by degrees, and alſo change colour, for in old age they are limber and whitiſh, they are joyned to the Neck by the Wind-pipe to the back and <hi>Sternum</hi> by the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> to the <hi>Pleura</hi> and <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> by the skin that compaſſeth them ſometimes, and ſometimes by ſome fibrous nexures. The action of the Lungues is reſpiration, which they are moved to by the copious flowing of hot blood to them, by the Arterious vein; the ſame is done by the Muſcles, breaſt and Lungues dilating and contracting themſelves in the Breaſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Organs of Voyce and Speech.</head>
               <p>THE Wind-pipe called <hi>Trachaea</hi> and <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> conduceth much to the perfecting of the Office of the Lungues, being the channel by which we draw air by inſpiration, and by expiration caſt out fuliginous vapors, and form voice and ſpeech: Its ſubſtance is partly Cartilaginous, that the voyce might be the eaſier, by reaſon of the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Organ, and partly Membranous where it is joyned to the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> that the dilation of it might not be hindred by lying upon a hard body. The Cartilaginous part is not all one, but compoſed of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many rings, of which the ſuperior are the greater; thoſe which are next the <hi>Gula,</hi> want the inferior part of their circumference, the reſt remain whol till after they have entred the ſubſtance of the Lungues, they are all curiouſly knit together, by a fleſhy Ligament, at laſt they end in Membranous channels like Arteries.</p>
               <p>The Wind-pipe is covered with a double Membrane, one external which they hold it hath from the <hi>Pleura,</hi> which is thin and firmly bound to the Ligaments of the Cartilages, the internal is thicker and common to the pallat of the mouth, of exquiſite ſence, and ready to caſt out what troubles it, it is bedewed with a fatty humor, that the ſound may be the cleerer, for being rough with flegm, the voice is hoarce, if dried with heat, it is not ſteady, [<hi>Clangoſus</hi> is when the voyce begins grave, and ends acute.]</p>
               <p>It hath veins from the external Jugular, Arteries from the <hi>Cartides,</hi> Nerves from the external branches of the ſixt pair, &amp; its <hi>Recurrens:</hi> Sex &amp; difference of Temperament alters the bigneſs of the wind-pipe; in form it is like a ſmall ſhrub that hath crooked branches every way, neither is it joyned to the Lungues only, but alſo to the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and by its head to the <hi>Os Hyois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is divided into two parts, <hi>Bronchus</hi> and <hi>Larinx,</hi> that which is called <hi>Bronchus</hi> is the lower part, long, and divided into many branches in both ſides of the Lungues: The <hi>Larynx</hi> is the ſuperior part or head of it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Cartilages and Muſcles, for the forming and expreſſing of ſounds.</p>
               <p>Its Cartilages are five, whereof the firſt is called <hi>Thyroides</hi> or buckler-like, from its form, being hollow within and gibbous without, which is that which ſticketh out in the Throat of ſome men: Its proceſſes are four, of which, two which are ſuperiour, and the longer are joyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the ſides of the <hi>Os Hyois;</hi> the other two which are the inferior and ſhorter, are joyned to the ring-like Cartilage.</p>
               <p>The Buckler-like Cartilage is moved by three pair of Muſcles, of which,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40322:51"/> the firſt which draws the Cartilage downward, proceeds from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and internal part of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and is inſerted into the inferior ſide of the Cartilage, it is called <hi>Sternothryroides</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>The ſecond pair which are very ſmall, move the Cartilage in the ſame manner, but ſomething obliquely; they take their origional forewards from the Ring-like Cartilage, and end in the inferior ſide of the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-like Cartilage, from whence they obtained the name <hi>Crycothyroides,</hi> though ſometimes on the ſides they are largely divided into two Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; by both theſe pairs the chink of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is not a little dilated: to draw the buckler-like Cartilage upwards, and bind together the chink of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> is the third pair ordained, which ariſeth from the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſide of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and ends about the inferior part of the Bucker-like Cartilage, and is called <hi>Hyotnyroides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Cartilage is called <hi>Cricoides,</hi> or ring-like, becauſe before 'tis round, behind hath a broad back, juſt like the Ring the Turkiſh Archers uſe to fight in (I doubt my Author was miſtaken, it was the Parthian horſe-men, not the Turks, that uſed to fight in Rings.)</p>
               <p>The third and fourth Cartilages, are called <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> becauſe their form makes a lip like a Laver, and they repreſent that part of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx</hi> which is called <hi>Glottis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both of them for the better framing of the voyce, are moved with four pair of Muſcles; of which, the firſt are called <hi>Thyroarytaenoides:</hi> It ariſeth from the middle internal part of the <hi>Thyrois,</hi> or buckler-like Cartilage, it is fleſhy, and raiſed upwards and forwards, into the ſides of the <hi>Arytaenois,</hi> and binds in the chink of the <hi>Larynx.</hi> The ſecond pair are called <hi>Arytenoides,</hi> they are very ſmall, yet fleſhy, and ariſe from the <hi>Arytenois,</hi> in what part it is joyned to the Ring-like Cartilage, it ends in the <hi>Arytenois;</hi> the extremities of them ſo meeting together, that they ſeem to be but one Muſcle; by this pair whilſt the Baſis of the <hi>Arytenois,</hi> is obliquely moved, and drawn together, the chink alſo of the <hi>Larynx</hi> is ſhut. The third pair is called <hi>Cricoarytenoides poſticum,</hi> for they ariſe from the <hi>Cricois,</hi> or Ring-like Cartilage, from its broad back, and are inſerted below into the <hi>Aritaenois,</hi> by a ſhort and Nervous tendon, which whilſt they move backwards, and outwards, they open the paſſage of the <hi>Larynx.</hi> The fourth pair is called <hi>Cricoarytaenoides La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teralis,</hi> becauſe they ariſe from the back ſide of the Ring-like Cartilage, and end in the <hi>Arytaenois,</hi> and dilate the paſſage of the <hi>Larynx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth Cartilage is called <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> or that which covers the Chink, leaſt the meat and drink ſhould paſſe down the Wind-pipe, and yet it ſhuts not ſo cloſe, but thin humors which paſſe down gently may paſſe that way: It is ſofter than the reſt of the Cartilages, and in form is like an Ivy leafe; the larger the <hi>Larynx</hi> is, the larger is the <hi>Glottis,</hi> and as that is larger, ſo the Voyce is ſtronge and graver: The leſſer, dryer, and narrower the <hi>Larynx</hi> is, the weaker, and ſhriller is the Voyce.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> called alſo <hi>Ypſiloides,</hi> is placed about the Baſis of the Tongue, both for its ſafeguard, and alſo for its motion, it conſiſts of three Bones, which being joyned together, repreſent the form
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40322:52"/> of the Greek letter <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſilon,</hi> of theſe the middlemoſt is largeſt, broad, and ſomething hollow, to which the other are joyned like Horn; many Cartilaginous appendices are joyned to theſe, which ſometimes alſo grow Bony, of which two are very freequent, in form and bigneſs like a grain of Wheat, and placed about the middle Bone, which is called the Baſis of the <hi>Hyois;</hi> two others ſtick to the lateral Bones, which are called Horns, and are knit to that Nervous Ligament of the Bodkin-like apendix, in what form they are often ſeen in the Body of Man, the eleventh and twelth Figure of the following Table will declare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> is removed by five pair of Muſcles, of theſe that which moveth it down right ariſeth, from the top of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and aſcends to the Baſis of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and is called <hi>Sterno Hyoides;</hi> another pair moves it obliquely downwards, which ariſeth from the ſuperior ſide of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> beſides the proceſſe called <hi>Coracois,</hi> and conſiſting of a Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Body, is carried to the ſides of the <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> and is called <hi>Coraco Hyoides:</hi> The third pair, which draws it obliquely upwards, ariſeth from the extremity of the Bodkin-like apendix, with a round Body, and is ſtretched to the Horns of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and is called <hi>Stylocerato Hyoides:</hi> The fourth pair which draws it directly upwards, ariſeth from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and lower part of the Chin, and paſſeth to the Bones of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ois,</hi> and is called <hi>Geniohyoides;</hi> to theſe we add a fift pair, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attributed to the tongue, and are called <hi>Geniogloſſum,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe inwardly from the Chin, under the former, and end in the Baſis of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> drawing it upwards; although in reſpect of the former, they might more rightly be called the internal <hi>Geniohyoides.</hi> The <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> is joyned to the Bodkin-like apendix, and to the Buckler-like Cartilage; eſpecially to the Tongue, for the reaſons mentioned before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> in its Cavity.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Tongue is the framer of Speech, and a great help to the ſwallowing of the Meat, and preparing it for the Stomach: It is of a fleſhy ſubſtance, ſoft, and rare, covered with a thin Skin, and full of pores; It hath two veins from the external Jugulars, which are called <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ninae,</hi> and as many Arteries from the <hi>Carotides;</hi> It hath two pair of Nerves, of which, the ſmalleſt comes from the fourth conjugalation, and is carried to the exterior part of the Tongue; but the greater which goes to the interior part of it, comes from the ſeventh conjugalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The Tongue is moved both by the Muſcles of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and alſo by its own proper Muſcles, which are four pair; the firſt which is genuin to the Tongue, lifts it up, and ariſeth from the Bodkin-like apendix, and is inſerted about the middle of it, and called <hi>Stylogloſſus;</hi> another pair ariſeth from the Baſis of the <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> and depreſſeth the Tongue, this alſo ends about the middle of the Tongue, and is called <hi>Baſiogloſſus:</hi> The third pair moves the Tongue to the Sides, and ariſe from the Horns of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and is joyned to the ſides of the Tongue, and for that cauſe called <hi>Ceratogloſſus;</hi> to theſe are added a fourth pair of Muſcles, ariſing from the hinder grinders, and are called <hi>Mylogloſſus,</hi> this is not immediatly inſerted into the Tongue, but into its Ligament, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to turn the Tongue upward.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40322:52"/>
               <p>The Tongue of man hath a mean habit divided upon a Line along the length of it: In reſpect of the harmony of manifeſt quallities it is temperate: If it be colder or moiſter, it is by accident; It is joyned to the parts under it by a ſtrong and Membranous Ligament, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which makes a bridle, the reſt of it is joyned to the <hi>Os Hyois,</hi> and <hi>Larinx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the root of the Tongue are two <hi>Glandula,</hi> which the Greeks call <hi>Antiades,</hi> and <hi>Pariſthmia,</hi> but the Latins <hi>Tonſillae;</hi> a fleſhy and looſe ſubſtance compaſſeth them about from the pallat, which as it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them in its Cavity, ſo it takes a moiſt excrement from them: There are other <hi>Glandulae</hi> under the Chin, between the <hi>Hyois,</hi> and the Muſcles of the Tongue; as alſo behind, which are called <hi>Parotides,</hi> the common uſe of them, is to receive the ſuperfluous moiſture, and to moiſten the parts adjacent to them.</p>
               <p>Neer the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> from the extremity of the pallat, is a Pendulous, Fungous, Red piece of fleſh produced, which Authors call <hi>Gargareon</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula:</hi> It is moved by two pair of Muſcles, of which, the external takes its original from the top of the Wedge-like Bone, neer the joynt of the <hi>Maxilla,</hi> and paſſing with his tendon by the Chink of that Bone, it is inſerted into the ſides of the <hi>Gargareon,</hi> which moves it forwards when the Tongue is depreſſed, the other or internal pair, begins a little higher, from the top of the Bone of the Temples, which looks to the internal wing of the Wedge-like Bone, and deſcends with a fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy and round Body, into the middle of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the eaſy deſcending of the nouriſhment, the pleaſantneſs of the Voyce, and the preparation of the air which is drawn into the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Neck is an apendix to the middle Ventricle, and is long for the better ordering the Voyce; the hinder part of which, is called <hi>Cervix,</hi> it hath both the common coverings of the Body, and veſſels, as Veins, Arteries, and Nerves; alſo <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and Muſcles of its own.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are ſeven, of which the <hi>Spinae Bifidae,</hi> and the tranſverſe proceſſes have holes through them for the Aſcending of the Vertebral Artery: The firſt is called <hi>Atlas,</hi> thin in ſubſtance, and without a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which holds up the Head, like the <hi>Olympus</hi> of the Body, to which it is knit with a ſtrong Ligament; It is larger in Lyons, and the like beaſts of prey, and hath tranſverſe proceſſes like wings, which adds not only ſtrength, but alſo ſome ſtiffeneſs to the Neck, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients falſly attributed to the ſeveral Bones: In the Cavity of this the ſecond <hi>Vertebrae</hi> is received, which for its turning, is called <hi>Epiſtropheus,</hi> it ſends out a round proceſſe, and long like a Tooth, from whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gave it the name <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> the head and firſt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are turned about this, it is both knit to the hinder part of the Head, and compaſſed about with a ſtrong Ligament: The third is called <hi>Axon</hi> by the Ancients, the reſt have no diſtinct names.</p>
               <p>The Neck is moved by four pair of Muſcles, of which, two bow it, and the other extend it; the firſt that bows it, is called <hi>Longus,</hi> which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40322:53"/> ariſing under the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> from the fifth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt is knit to the firſt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck; to this long Muſcle is a ſhort one adjoyned for its ſhortneſs called <hi>Brevius,</hi> ariſing from the tranſverſe proceſſes of the inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck to the Baſis of the Head, and therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the pair called <hi>Maſtois,</hi> bows not the Neck, but the Head. The ſecond pair for its form ſake is called <hi>Scalenum,</hi> which ariſeth from the firſt Rib of the Breaſt, with a broad and fleſhy beginning, and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing ſlenderer by degrees, paſſeth by its oblique <hi>fibrae</hi> to the tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck: the third and fourth pair we ſhall deſcribe in the following Chapter amongſt thoſe Muſcles that extend the Head.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 12.</hi> Of the Muſcles of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> Back, and certain of the Head.</head>
               <p>VEry many Muſcles occupy the Back, of which ſome are proper to it, and ſome move the parts neer it.</p>
               <p>The firſt in order of diſſection are the two Muſcles called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezii</hi> and <hi>Culcullares</hi> becauſe being joyned together they reſemble a Fryars Cool, they move the <hi>Sapula;</hi> they begin at the hinder part of the Head, and the hinder proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, being joyned by a Membranous nexure to the eight ſuperior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back; from hence being knit together by degrees, they end in part of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> on the top of the ſhoulder, and eſpecially in the <hi>Spina</hi> of the <hi>Scapula</hi> and the Baſis of it; neither is their motion ſimple, their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal having ſuch latitude, for by reaſon of the diverſity of their <hi>fibrae,</hi> they move the ſhoulder backwards as well as obliquely upwards or downwards.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40322:56"/>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40322:56"/>
               <p>Under the <hi>Trapezii</hi> is the pair of Muſcles called <hi>Rhomboides,</hi> from their form, this alſo is peculiar to the <hi>Scapula;</hi> they take their beginning from the three inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and as many of the ſpinous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the ſuperior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back; afterwards deſcending ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely with a fleſhy beginning and end, they are carried to the Baſis of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> which they move backwards and obliquely upwards. The Muſcle called <hi>Serratus Anticus minor,</hi> moves the <hi>Scapula</hi> forwards, which we mentioned in the ninth Chapter. Laſtly, the pair called <hi>Levatorium</hi> is proper to the <hi>Scapula,</hi> ſo called from their office; they take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the tranſverſe proceſſes of the ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, they are ſtretched downwards with a fleſhy and ſtrong end, and knit to the ſuperior angle of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and lift both it and the ſhoulder up forward.</p>
               <p>That the Muſcles of the Back may be the better diſcried, you muſt firſt ſeparate the broad pair of Muſcles, which are called <hi>Latiſſimum Dorſi,</hi> although they are peculiar to the ſhoulder and not to the Back, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the poſteriour proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> is broad and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous; they begin from the ſixt <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back even to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and part of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> from hence they paſs both above and below by the ſides of the Back, till they come to the inferior angle of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> being fleſhy and contracted they end about the head of the Shoulder with a ſhort and ſtrong Tendon, which ſtoutly moves it backwards.</p>
               <p>The proper Dorſal Muſcles are both thoſe called <hi>Serratus Poſticus,</hi> from their tooth-like productions in form of a ſaw; alſo the <hi>Sacrolumbi,</hi> the longeſt of the Back, and the <hi>Semiſpinati.</hi> Of the <hi>Serrati Piſtici,</hi> two are ſuperior and leſſer, two inferior and greater: The ſuperiour ariſe with a thin and Membranous beginning from the hinder proceſſes of the three inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and the firſt Spine of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, afterwards being fleſhy in their deſcention; they are carried to the three or four ſuperior Ribs, according as they are endewed with two or three tooth-like productions: The inferior <hi>Serrati poſtici,</hi> ariſe from the Spines of the inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, with a Membranous beginning, then running tranſverſly they are knit to the intervals of the inferior Ribs, others take the beginnings of them both, from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Ribs, and their ends in the Spines of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and that they conduce to the turning about the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> The original of the Muſcles <hi>Sacrolumbi,</hi> is from the extremity of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is fleſhy inwards, nervous outwards, whence ariſing up about the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back, they depart a little to the Ribs, from the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Muſcle, into which they are inſerted with various Tendons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Ribs in expiratton. The beginning and progreſs of the longeſt Muſcles of the Back is from the <hi>Os Sacrum, Os Ilium,</hi> and <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and are at firſt united to the <hi>Sacrolumbi,</hi> and are firſt diſtinguiſhed about the lower <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back, and beſtow their Tendines upon the tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back and Loyns, and they are ſtrong extenders of the Back, and of all thoſe <hi>Vertebrae</hi> that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: The <hi>Semiſpinati</hi> ſerve alſo to move and extend the Back, they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40322:57"/> are altogether fixed in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> and furniſh them with Tendons from the top to the bottom. This is certain, theſe three Muſcles we ſpake of, if we conſider the conjunction of their beginnings, the one-neſs of their Membranes, and the community of their office, they make but one Muſcle; but if we regard the multitude of their Tendons, and variety of their endings, they ſeem very many.</p>
               <p>Under the <hi>Sacrolumbi</hi> and the longeſt Muſcles, are the two extenders of the Loyns, called <hi>Sacri;</hi> theſe riſe externally from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and by a various progreſs faſten their Tendons in the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns and their oblique proceſſes: The bowers of Loyns are oppoſed to theſe, called <hi>Quadrati,</hi> which ariſe internally from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and <hi>Ilium;</hi> they have a large and fleſhy beginning, and grow ſlender by degrees, and joyn themſelves to the tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, bowing them.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles which are referred to the Head, ſome move the whol Head, others certain parts of it, of which in the Chapter following: They which move the whol Head, are called, <hi>Muſculi Splenii, Complexi, Recti majores et minores</hi> which extend it; the ſuperior and inferior oblique Muſcles move it about, the <hi>Maſtoides</hi> bow it: The Muſcles are called <hi>Splenii</hi> from the form of their ſides, they have a double beginning, partly from the five Spines of the inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, partly from ſo many of the ſuperior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt, and end in the hinder part of the Head with ſomewhat oblique <hi>fibrae: Complexi</hi> are ſo called from the diſtinction of parts, they ariſe from the four tranſverſe proceſſes of the ſuperior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt, and from the Spine of the ſeventh <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, and are ſtrongly inſerted into the Head from the middle part of the Dug-like prominence: <hi>Recti majores</hi> are ſhort fleſhy Muſcles, ariſing from the Spine of the ſecond <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and ending about the middle of the <hi>Occiput: Recti minores</hi> are under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ariſing from the bunch of the firſt <hi>vertebra,</hi> ſomething divided in their progreſs, and end with the former.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Head is not only to be extended, but alſo to be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, this is done by ſmall, yet very ſtrong Muſcles; of which, two are called the Superior, two the Inferior Obliques: The Superior Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ariſe from the tranſverſe proceſs of the firſt <hi>vertebra,</hi> and end in the hinder part of the Head neer the ſides of the external right Muſcles; The Inferior Oblique ariſe from the Spine of the ſecond <hi>vertebra</hi> of the Neck, and end in the tranſverſe proceſs of the firſt <hi>vertebra</hi> and therefore this <hi>vertebra</hi> being moved, moves about the Head.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maſtoides</hi> being long and thick Muſcles, bow the Head; they riſe partly from the top of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> partly from the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a Body almoſt double and Oblique, by the neck to the Dug-like proceſs, from which they obtain their name; to theſe are joyned as companions the two Muſcles in the Neck, which ariſe from the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe proceſſes of its <hi>vertebrae,</hi> and ariſe to the Baſis of the Head, and bow it together with them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Muſcles being removed, the extenders of the Neck remain, namely, two Tranverſals, and two Spinals; The Tranſverſals take their
<pb facs="tcp:40322:59"/>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40322:59"/> beginning from the ſix Tranſverſe proceſſes of the ſuperior <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt, and end in the Tranſverſe proceſſes of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Neck: The Spinals ariſe from the ſeven Spines of the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt, and the five Roots of the Tranſverſe proceſſes of the Neck, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving various beginnings, and end in the Spine of the ſecond <hi>vertebra.</hi>

               <p>HAving finiſhed the lower and middle Ventricle, we come to the upper, which is the ſeat of thoſe noble functions of the Soul; this is bounded with the circumference of the Head: It hath the Face before, the forepart of the Head in the middle, and the hinder part behind; the external parts are to be viewed which ſerve both for covering and defence, and theſe are either common to other parts or proper to the Head, alſo the brain it ſelf and amongſt the Organs of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Eyes and Ears.</p>
               <p>We will begin with thoſe that are common and external, of which, the skin upon the upper part of the Head is remarkable for its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſo it may defend the Head the better, and give the better roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Hair, which Nature hath placed thick for the ornament and ſafeguard of that part, to defend it from the cold blaſts of wind, and the parching heat of the Sun; underneath the skin is fat, but very little, leſt the thickneſs of it ſhould hinder the tranſpiration of vapors; next to the fat is a fleſhy Panicle in which we will ſhew the thin expanſions of the Muſcles in their proper places.</p>

               <p>It hath Bones for its ſafeguard both various and ſtrong; theſe are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Membrane which is called <hi>Pericranium,</hi> which is thin, yet double and exquiſite in ſence, by reaſon of the Nerves diſtributed unto it, by the hinder part of the Head and the Temples: It is firmly joyned by Sutures by the Junctures of the Bones, even to the <hi>Dura mater</hi> with Nervous <hi>Fibrae,</hi> from whence there is an eaſie conſent between both Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes: The Bones of the Head are referred either to the Skull or the Cheeks; to the Skull pertain the Bones of the Fore-head, the fore and hinder part of the Head, the Temples, <hi>Sphenois,</hi> and <hi>Cribriforme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bone of the Forehead is of a great bigneſs, 'tis uſually but one, ſometimes two, even in ſuch as are grown up; it hath a double plate fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſubſtance like pumice; it hath a large paſſage to the Noſtrils, ſometimes 'tis ſingle, ſometimes it hath one or two bridges, which a Marrowy Body, compaſſed about with a green Membrane, guardeth, they ſay to prepare the air that paſſeth to the brain; its thickneſs, if you compare it with the fore and hinder part of the Head is mean, in figure it is almoſt circular, its paſſages are ſmall, defending the angles of the Eyes on each ſide; it hath two holes about the Eye-brows, which give paſſage to the Nerves of the third Conjugation, although often times Nature doth not give perfect holes, but little trenches only for the ſafeguard and diſtribution of the ſaid Nerves; To theſe a third hole is added for the creſt of the <hi>Os Ethmois,</hi> which opens it ſelf in the ſaid hole, the Bone of the Forehead is joyned before to the Bone called <hi>Caneiforme</hi> to the <hi>Ethmois,</hi> to the ten Bones of the Cheek, above by the coronal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Bones of the fore part of the Head.</p>
               <p>The Bones of the fore part of the Head are in number two, and are thinner than the reſt, and in form unequally ſquare, they have a kind of ſmoothneſs to the touch, and ſmall holes for the Veſſels neer the Suture called <hi>Sagittalis;</hi> within it is garniſhed with ſmall trenches for the veins which ariſe up by the <hi>Dura mater;</hi> it is divided by its proper Suture which is called <hi>Sagittalis;</hi> in its circumference it is joyned to the bones of the Forehead, hinder part of the Head, and Temples.</p>
               <p>The Bones of the Temples are alſo two, leſs than the reſt in bigneſs, and not every where diſtinguiſhed by a double <hi>Lamen;</hi> they are harder than the reſt, and therefore called <hi>Petroſa,</hi> or Rocky; they are ſo thin about the middle that if you hold them againſt the light you may ſee through them; their form above is circular, beneath various, they ſtick out in diverſe proceſſes, and that externally towards the face, they have a crooked proceſs, which being joyned with the proceſs of the firſt Bone of the upper Cheek, make the <hi>Os Jugale;</hi> then they have a <hi>Maſtois,</hi> or Dug-like proceſs, becauſe it repreſents the Udder of a Heifer; in age they have the <hi>Stylois</hi> which ends like a Bodkin, but this is more truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Apendix than a Proceſs; Inwardly the Bones of the Temples make the broad Proceſs called <hi>Petroſum,</hi> in which the internal Cavities of the Ears are formed, &amp; certain ſmal Bones of them which we ſhal ſhew in the ſixteen Chapter; It hath three Cavities, whereof, one contains the paſſage of Hearing, the ſecond receives the Joynt of the inferior Cheek, the third is common to the hinder part of the Head; It hath five holes, of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40322:60"/> which, the firſt is conſpicuous in the rocky proceſs and gives paſſage to the Nerve of the fift pair; the ſecond is larger and unequal, ſcituated under the Bodkin-like Appendix, and ſends the greater branch of the Artery <hi>Carotis,</hi> by the fift hole of the <hi>Os Cuneiforme</hi> to the Brain; the third is famous in bigneſs and common to the hinder part of the Head, and gives ingreſs to the Jugular Vein and the leſſer branch of the Artery <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotis</hi> and egreſs to the Nerve of the ſixt pair; the fourth is obſervable between the Dug-like Proceſs, and the Bodkin-like Appendix, and ſends out the hard branch of the fift pair by a long channel; the fift, which in ſome bodies is wanting, is placed behind the Dug-like Proceſs, and gives a branch of the external Jugular or paſſage through the Skull. To theſe they ad a narrow hole like a chink, and unequal, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſmall Artery from the fore ſide of the rocky Proceſs. The reſt of the holes obvious in this Proceſs, we ſhall handle in the Hiſtory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The Bones of the Temples are joyned to the Bones of the fore part of the Head, by the ſcaly or falſe Sutures; they ſtick to the Bone of the Forehead, the Wedg-like Bone, and that of the hinder part of the Head.</p>
               <p>The Bone in the hinder part of the Head is but one in ſuch as are grown up, being thicker than the reſt, although the lower part be thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt where it is ſtrengthened by that long knob ariſing up to it: Its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities are nine, of which, two are remarkable, which contain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances of the <hi>Cerebellum;</hi> its holes are very many, of which, the greateſt paſſeth the marrow of the Back to the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> It doth not conſtitute the ſecond and third hole it ſelf, but with the bone of the Temples, of which we ſpake before; neer to theſe is the fourth and fift, which is proper to the hinder part of the Head, little and round, by which the ſeventh pair of Nerves deſcend out of the Skull; to theſe ſometimes is added a ſixt and ſeventh hole, to which Nature appointeth the multiplied branches of the Vertebral veins and arteries; the hinder part of the Head is more even on the outſide, but internally various, and in a manner reſembles a figure of five ſides, it is ſeparated from the bones of the Fore part of the Head with the Suture <hi>Lambdois,</hi> from the middle and ſides of the bones of the Temples by the <hi>Sphenois,</hi> alſo from the firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, by a double Proceſs both for its motion and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in its meeting with the <hi>Lambdois</hi> and Sagittal Suture, ſometimes there is a ſmal bone of a Triangular form, ſometimes with a ſingle, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a double <hi>Lamen,</hi> although not exactly produced to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite places, which is an excellent Antidote for the Falling-ſickneſs; to this, Nature often forms leſſer bones, which are like to it, between the Liniaments of the true Sutures, conſiſting uſually of a ſimple <hi>Lamen</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the inferior <hi>Lamen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Os Sphenois</hi> or Wedg-like Bone, makes up the Baſis of the Skull; it is only one in ſuch as are grown up, various in reſpect of thickneſs and thinneſs, and manifold in Form, for it is garniſhed with many Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of which, ſome are external; and of theſe, ſome on the fore part, and for their figure ſake are called <hi>Perigoides,</hi> or Wing-like, others on the back part, which are ſtretched out with two Tops towards the Bodkin-like
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40322:61"/> Appendix; the internal Proceſſes are various as well as the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, of which two are forewards, and form a broad beginning, end in a point, the backward Proceſſes are as many, which are ſtretched out broad, when they are elegantly formed they have two points in their extremities lightly bowed in the middle; and theſe proceſſes together with the ſpace between them, are compared by Authors to the Saddle of a Horſe; the Cavities of the <hi>Os Sphenois</hi> are many, that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is produced in the middle of the Saddle is famous above the reſt, &amp; receives the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> neer which two others ariſe, which are ſmaller, alſo they are worthy to be noted which are in the wing-like Proceſſes, which are long and deep Cavities and give ſecurity to the internal Muſcle called <hi>Pteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gois:</hi> In both ſides of the <hi>Sphenois</hi> are ſeven holes, of which, the firſt is neer the foremoſt proceſs of the Saddle, and admits the optick Nerve to the Eyes; the ſecond from a round beginning ends in a chink, and through it is the ſecond pair of Nerves and a Branch of the third carried to the Eye; alſo a large Branch of the Artery <hi>Carotis</hi> with the abounding humidity from the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria;</hi> the third hole which is under the ſecond is very little and round, by which a Branch of the Nerve of the third pair is carried to the temporal Muſcle, and <hi>Pterigoides;</hi> the fourth is on the external ſide of the Apple of the Eye, and reſembles a large ditch unequally broad rather than a hole, by which the firſt branch of the Nerve of the fourth Conjugation, with that of the third pair is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the temporal Muſcle, and deſcending to the bottom of the upper Jaw, it is diſtributed partly to the Noſe, partly to its ſixt Bone, and ſends a ſmall branch to be diſtributed to the Pallat; the fift hole is under the poſterior Proceſs of the Saddle, long and rough, and gives paſſage to the greater Branch of the Artery <hi>Carotis;</hi> the ſixt is obſervable on the external ſide of the ſame, oval in figure, and gives extramiſſion to the fourth pair of Nerves; the ſeventh is neer the ſixt, very ſmall and round, and ſends the ſmaller Branch of the Internal Jugular Vein, to the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> The <hi>Os Sphenois</hi> is joyned to the firſt Bone of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Jaw, as alſo to the fourth and ſixt below the Pallat, on the ſides to the Proceſſes of the Bones of the Temples, before to the bone of the Forehead, and behind to that of the hinder part of the Head, by tke Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called <hi>Mendoſae</hi> and <hi>Harmoniae,</hi> which age moſt commonly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terates.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Os Ethmois</hi> or Sieve-like Bone, is leſs than the orher Bones belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Skull, and various in habit, it ſeems to be compoſed of ſix parts, of which the firſt and ſecond is full of holes like a Sieve, and thence came the name to the whol Bone; it is covered with the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> but it is full of pores, not only to take in air and ſmels, but alſo to put out excrements: the third is the interior proceſs, not much unlike a Cocks Comb, riſing between the Nerves of ſmelling, or the Papillar Proceſſes of the Brain: the fourth is another part of the Proceſs oppoſite to the former, thin yet hard, and diſtinguiſheth the the Noſtrils above: the fift nnd ſixt parts are altogether ſpongious and full of holes, and guard the upper Cavities of the Noſtrils on the ſides, and almoſt equals the wideneſs of them: It is joyned to the Bone of the Forehead and to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40322:61"/> the ſecond of the upper Jaw, and to the <hi>Os Sphenois</hi> by light <hi>Harmonia,</hi> which old age ſometimes takes away.</p>
               <p>The Jaws follow, of which, the ſuperior is compoſed of twelve bones, ſix on each ſide; the firſt is joyned to the external angle of the Eye, and the foreward proceſs of the Bone of the Temples, and by their proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, make the <hi>Os Jugale:</hi> The ſecond makes the inner angle of the Eye, and hath a large paſſage, by which the overflowing moiſture of the Eyes deſcends to the Noſtrils: The third is interpoſed between theſe two: The fourth is the greateſt of all, and occupies a great part of the Cheek and Pallat, and gives holes to the upper teeth; it hath a conſpicuous hole neer the apple of the Eye, by which a Nerve paſſeth from the third pair: The fift, together with its fellow, makes up the Noſe: The ſixt, with its fellow makes up the extremity of the Pallat; and all theſe are joyned rather by <hi>Harmonia</hi> than Sutures.</p>
               <p>This Jaw is accounted movable in the <hi>Crocodile</hi> by the Ancients, not diſtinguiſhing his ſmall Skull from his huge Jaw, with which it is lifted up when he moves his Jaw, his Body being neer the Earth by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of his feet; for what Bones ſoever make the ſuperior Jaw in <hi>Crocodiles</hi> either of the Land or Water, are firmly joyned to the Skull by <hi>Harmonia:</hi> neither is it otherwiſe in Serpents and Fiſhes, in all which is the nexure of Bones; neither are there any Muſcles properly moving the ſuperior Jaw.</p>
               <p>The inferior Jaw in age is but one Bone, famous both in hardneſs, thickneſs, and ſtrength; It hath two Proceſſes, the one acute called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone;</hi> the other obtuſe called <hi>Condylus:</hi> It hath holes for the Teeth as the ſuperior Jaw hath: In the internal Superficies it hath two holes, for the beginnings of the aforeſaid proceſſes, by which a Branch of the Nerve of the fourth Conjugation is admitted to be diſtributed to the Teeth, In the external Superficies it hath alſo two, by which the ſame Branch paſſeth forwards to the lips, their Muſcles and Skin: Laſtly, by its thicker Proceſs it is joyned to the rocky Bone, a Membranous Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being between.</p>
               <p>The Jaws are ſingularly armed with the Teeth, which are ſmall Bones and ſerve not only the chew the meat, but alſo by reſiſting the refluxion of the air, they help the better to pronounce the words: each Tooth receives an Artery from the <hi>Carotides,</hi> ſmall veins from the Jugulars, and Nerves from the Branch of the fourth pair by which the <hi>Perioſtion</hi> which covers the Roots of them, and alſo the Teeth themſelves are exquiſite in ſence. In Women there are fourteen, in Men fifteen, and often ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in one Jaw; in Men they are of a mean bigneſs, and differ partly in figure, partly in office; for ſome are ſharp, which are called the Dog-Teeth; others, although they are acute, yet they have broader extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities than the Dog-Teeth, and are called Cutters, others are called Grinders, the furthermoſt of which come forth either in Man-hood or old age, and are called the Teeth of wiſdom: the Cutters are four, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before, and are the firſt that appear in Children, on both ſides of which, is a Dog-Tooth added, which are called Eye-Teeth, the reſt of the Jaw the Grinders occupy, which are large, broad, and ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40322:62"/> they are placed in the holes of the Jaws, either with three or four roots, or with but one, as the Cutters and Dog-Teeth, their jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture the Ancients call <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Muſcles which move theſe parts of the Head, remain yet to be ſpoken of, to wit, the Forehead, Eye-lids, Noſe, Ears, Lips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Jaws; On each ſide of the Forehead is one, which deſcending from its mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle region is ended in the Eye-brows, which lifteth it up, and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles it.</p>
               <p>Two Muſcles ſhut the Eye-lids, which by a ſemicircular Production, being extended from the internal angles to the external, ſhut them, and yet they are more properly one Muſcle than two; to theſe they ad the Ciliar Muſcle, which compaſſing the brims cauſeth the more exquiſite ſhutting: A ſingular Muſcle opens the Eye-lids, of which in the Fifteen Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles on each ſide lift up and diduce the Muſcles of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, of which the firſt is like a Triangle, and deſcends from the top of the Noſe by the ſides, even to the wing; the other ariſeth from the Bone of the Jaw neer it, and ends partly in the exterior wing of the Noſe, and partly in the upper part of the Lip, thereby moving and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both of them up: Two ſlender Muſcles dilate the wing of the Noſe, which run Tranſverſly by the top of the Noſe; to theſe within the wing are two Muſcles oppoſed, which are like them in bigneſs, produced from the extremities of the Bones of the Noſe, and opened in each of its wings, which gently bind to the Noſe, although the orbicular Muſcles of the Lips help forward and finiſh this office.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles common to both Checks and Lips are called both the <hi>Quadrati</hi> and <hi>Buccinator; Galen</hi> calls the <hi>Quadratus</hi> a Muſculous expanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for indeed it is a Membrane placed under the fat, but hath an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique contexture of fleſhy <hi>fibrae;</hi> its beginning is broad from the <hi>Sternum, Clavicula,</hi> Neck, and Shoulder, it ends in the Chin, where ſticking to the inferior Jaw, it draws it and the parts adjoyning to it downwards; the other is called <hi>Buccinator</hi> becauſe it ſwels up in ſuch as blow the Trumpet: It takes its original from the Gums of the upper Jaw, and being compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within with the common Tunicle of the mouth; it ends in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Jaw, and makes the inward hollowneſs of the Cheek.</p>
               <p>Properly five pair of Muſcles are ſubſervient to the Lips, of which the firſt lifts up the upper Lip: Its beginning is from the upper Jaw where the Cavity of the Cheek is, and being compaſſed about with much fat it deſcends to the upper Lip; neer this from the very ſame Jaw ariſeth another pair, thin and broad, which being inſerted into the Lip moves it upwards: The third pair is fleſhy and round, ariſing from the <hi>Os Jugale,</hi> and paſſing obliquely by the Cheeks, ends in the confines of both Lips, and draws them upwards to the ſides: The fourth pair riſeth a little lower, neer the ſides of the inferior Jaw, and from a broad beginning by an oblique Proceſs becomes ſlender, which draw the inferior Lip down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being inſerted into the ſides of it neer the end: The fift pair which is moſt conſpicuous in fleſhy Bodies, ariſeth about the middle of the Chin, and aſcendeth with right ſtrings to the nether Lip, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
<pb facs="tcp:40322:64"/>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40322:64"/> it: To theſe the binder together of the Lips is to be added, which their ſoft and ſpongy ſubſtance makes, which conſiſts of <hi>fibrae</hi> turned in an Orb like a <hi>Sphincter:</hi> As for the Muſcles of the Ears we ſhall ſpeak of them when we ſpeak of the Ears themſelves, amongſt which are thoſe called <hi>Occipitals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The motion of the inferior Jaw is very ſtrong, and moved by ſtrong Muſcles, which are in number alſo five pair, the firſt pair is called <hi>Crota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi> or Temporals, becauſe being covered with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> they ariſe with a thin and broad beginning, about the fore part of the Head and Bone of the Temples, the neerer it comes to the <hi>Os Jugale</hi> the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker it is, under which deſcending, it ends in the acute proceſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Jaw, with a ſhort yet ſtrong Tendon, this draws it upwards: Its <hi>fibrae</hi> the more they recede from the middle, the more they paſs oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the Tendon: wounds hapning in this pair of Muſcles are not equally alike dangerous, for in its ſuperior region being wounded by oblique ſtroaks, the hurt avoids death, in which place when by a fall the bone of the Temple is crackt, the life may be ſaved by ſetting to the trepan, but ſuch hurts as afflict the lower and nervous part of it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger life by convulſions. The ſecond pair is called <hi>Digaſtricum</hi> or <hi>Biventre,</hi> and takes its original neer the Dug-like Proceſs, this in its mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle paſſage grows to a Nervous or Tendinous Body, then it is fleſhy again till it come to the fore part of the Chin, where it ends inwardly and draws the Jaw downwards, in which motion Nature hath provided a Ligament to ſtop its falling back too far: The <hi>Muſculus Quadratus</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before concurs in office with this. The third pair is called <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> and <hi>Maſſeterium,</hi> having partly a Nervous, and partly a fleſhy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ariſing from the ſuperior Jaw and <hi>Os Jugale,</hi> and are broadly and ſtrongly inſerted into the nether Jaw, which by reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of its ſtrings, it moves to the right and left, and forwards. The fourth pair is called <hi>Pterygoides,</hi> or the internal Alar, ſo called becauſe it proceeds from the internal ſeat of the Wing-like Proceſs: it is fleſhy and carried to the inferior part of the inward part of the inferior Jaw, by a broad and ſtrong Tendon, which it draws up, and when it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, it draws it back. The fift pair is called <hi>Pterygoides</hi> or the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Alar; this begins often with a double body, and fleſhy, from the external ſide of the wing-like proceſs, and is alſo faſtned in the internal ſide of the lower Jaw: It withdraws the inferior Jaw and moves it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 14.</hi> Of the Brain. and <hi>Cerebellum</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat the Brain it ſelf which is the Temple of Wiſdom and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may come to view, it is neceſſary that we take away its cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and they are two Membranes, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Meninge,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians, Mater,</hi> and our Chyrurgians from them: the <hi>Arabians</hi> uſing to expreſs the ſoft ſeat or covering of any thing by the name <hi>MOTHER.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe, that which doth not immediately cover the Brain, is called <hi>Craſſa Meninx</hi> or <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and it is endewed with not a few Veins and Arteries which aſcend by the ſides of it: The Veins come from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Branch of the internal Jugular, the Arteries from the greater and leſſer Branch of the internal <hi>Carotis,</hi> both of them repleniſh it with Blood and vital Spirit; It looſly embraceth the Brain that ſo it may not hinder its increaſe; it is rough without, and ſmooth within, it is doubled with a double Proceſs, of which, that which is ſtretched forwards above the middle of the Brain, for the figure ſake, is called <hi>Falx,</hi> becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a hook; the other is ſhorter, and defines the bounds of the Brain and <hi>Cerebellum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Proceſſes are certain Cavities or Channels made, ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome leſſer; Of the greater, two climb up the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> to the right and left by an oblique paſſage, by the ſides of the hinder part of the Head, and in their beginnings they admit the greater Branch of the internal Jugular Vein; the third of the greater Cavities, being ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched along the longitude of the <hi>Falx,</hi> diſperſeth copious branches both to the <hi>Meninges</hi> and alſo to the middle of the Skull; here is often a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of excrements and a filthy putrifaction, and ſometimes callous matter and ſtones found in a Diſſection; the fourth of the greater Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is ſhorter, paſſing between the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> two Branches being firſt produced, it is partly beſtowed upon the callous Body, and partly enters in two parts, the foremoſt Ventricles of the Brain, making a portion of the plexure called <hi>Chorois:</hi> Where there is a concourſe and community of theſe Cavities, there that Funnel called <hi>Herophilianum</hi> is conſtituted: The <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is firmly joyned to the Sutures of the Skul, eſpecially to the <hi>Os Sphenois;</hi> at other places it is at diſtance both from the Skull and the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> as the increaſe and decreaſe of the Brain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>The other Membrane for the diverſity of its habit is called <hi>Tenuis Meninx</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater:</hi> It is a very thin and ſoft Membrane, not only wrapping the Brain round, but alſo enrowling the turnings of many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40322:65"/> Veins and Arteries which accompany it, which may be eaſily ſeparated from it.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Brain</hi> comprehends both that properly called ſo, and alſo the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> it is made of a cleer ſubſtance of the Seed, and makes the animal Spirit, by which the Soul which is the Governeſs of the Body performs both Sence internal and external, and alſo voluntary motion, therefore in living Bodies it is ſwelled with gentle heat and Spirit; in dead Bodies being diſſected in thin ſlices it ſhines like Alablaſter: The Ancients thought the Brain was clouded or obſcured by Melancholly, or vapors drawn up thither; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rightly conceived that wounds paſſing deeply into its Cavities were mortal, and yet here is a huge dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, either by reaſon of different properties in Nature, or the ambient air, for light offences either of the Skull or <hi>Meninges</hi> kill ſome preſently, and others whoſe Brain it ſelf is wounded eſcape, yea, although ſome part of it be taken away, and ſeparated by reaſon of putrifaction, alſo the wound growing together, the leaden Inſtruments uſed in the cure, remain many yeers fixed in the Brain and <hi>Meninges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Brain receives Veins on each ſide from the internal branches of the Jugulars, and ſmall paſſages from the Cavities of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Blood: It hath Arteries from the <hi>Carotides</hi> and thoſe which riſe up by the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> which have but a ſingle Tunicle like the Veins; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain hath no Nerve at all, and therefore 'tis void of ſence, although it give original to all the Nerves.</p>
               <p>Its largeneſs in Man is famous, and it increaſeth and decreaſeth as the <hi>Moon</hi> doth; it is divided into the right part and the left, by the Hook-like Proceſs of the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> it hath diverſe Cavities which we ſhall lay open in the particular diſſection; it hath an evident heat, although compared with the other Bowels which are hotter, it may be accounted cold and moiſt; alſo it is made moiſt by accident, ſeing the vapors ſent unto it from the Breaſt and Stomach, are turned into water, from whence flowing to the inferior parts (if it have not power to reſolve them) it brings ſickneſs in the ſmall Guts: It is garniſhed with many circulations like the River <hi>Meander;</hi> above, it is round like a Sphere, and therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it the Heaven of Man, becauſe in figure it imitates the moſt Sacred and Noble part of the World: It is ſeated by the moſt wiſe God, within the ſtrong defence of the Skull, and the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> The Brain is moved like the Arteries, not ſo much by any inherent vertue of its own, as by vertue communicated by the Heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cerebellum</hi> is another part of the Brain, produced of the ſame ſubſtance with its ſelf, and endewed with the ſame Veſſels although fewer in number; it is nothing neer ſo big as the Brain, and muſt yeild to it in roundneſs, but it conſiſts of more <hi>Lamens,</hi> it is hid within the large Cavities of the hinder part of the Head, and its office is conſecrated to the <hi>MEMORY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things thus premiſed we come now to the Method of Diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the diſtinctions of the ſubſtances of the Brain are to be viewed, as alſo the callous Body; the two foremoſt Ventricles, the <hi>Speculum Lucidum,</hi> the <hi>Fornix,</hi> the <hi>Plexus Choroides;</hi> the third Ventricle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40322:66"/> and beſide that the Eminences in the fore and hinder part of it, then the Brain being deduced to the ſides, and the ſhorter Proceſs of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> being, draw away the Nerves of ſmelling: The firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth Conjugation of Nerves, the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> and <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> are to be obſerved, then the Brain and <hi>Cerebellum</hi> being turned to the right ſide, the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> the Proceſs and Cavity of the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> which is called the fourth Ventricle, and the beginning of the Marrow of the Back comes to view.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Brain is double, the external which is ſofter and of a more aſhy or yellow colour, and the internal which is more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and white; this they compare to the Marrow, the other to the Bark.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corpus Calloſuſn,</hi> or Callous Body is a hard portion of the Brain, conſpicuous between its foremoſt diviſion, under the ſides of which the two foremoſt Ventricles lies: Theſe Ventricles are the largeſt Cavities of the Brain, compaſſed with a thin ſkin, and by their bowing exceed in length its Marrowy ſubſtance, on the upper part from a broad and blunt beginning it grows ſomething ſharp towards the third Ventricle or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cavity; from hence on the backward parts, they grow roundiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain downwards towards the Baſis of the Brain, and being bowed like a hook toward their firſt beginning, they are attenuated, and end neer the original of the Optick Nerves: They are divided into the right and left Ventricle, a thin partition paſſing between them and the ſubſtance of the Brain, which being withdrawn and held againſt the light is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and therefore called <hi>Speculum Lucidum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this is joyned above, the <hi>Fornix,</hi> or vault, being a callous ſubſtance of the Brain; it obtained this name becauſe like the vault of a Houſe, it ſuſtains the waight of the Brain, which elſe would fall down into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities: It is underpropped with three legs, of which two are ſtretched out downwards towards the Baſis of the Brain, and embracing the root of the Marrow of the Back neer the ſides, which a ſingular prominence being neer, with a crooked vally they deſign the inferior Cavity of the foremoſt Ventricle on each ſide; <hi>Arantius</hi> gave the name of <hi>Hippocampus</hi> or Sea-horſe, and Silk-worm to them: the third leg of the vault is ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forward over the common Cavity of the ſaid Ventricles.</p>
               <p>Beſides in the foremoſt Ventricles is obvious, the <hi>Plexus Choroides</hi> made of a ſubtil Membrane, and very ſmall <hi>Glandulae,</hi> and ſmal branches of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels variouſly infolded, both from the fourth Cavity, and the branches of the <hi>Carotis</hi> and Vertebral Arteries; That neat and wonderful diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is ſeen by the lower Cavity of the Ventricles, in which, even as in the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> the Blood is prepared for the Generation of the animal Spirit in the Brain; But the Ventricles before mentioned, together with thoſe that follow, by the aprobation of Modern Phyſitians, are ordained for the collection of air and abounding flegm.</p>
               <p>The chink, which is in the valley of the foremoſt ventricles, being lightly drawn aſide makes the third ventricle of the Brain, according to the opinion of the Ancients; in which two paſſages are obſervable, of which the foremoſt is carried down to the Funnel, a Proceſs ſticking up,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40322:66"/> which they compare to a womans Privities; the hinder which they liken to the Fundament, is carried to the Cavity of the Marrow of the Back, and ſhews that ſpace, which the beginnings of that marrow make by their mutual concourſe, being famous with four protuberances, and maketh the fourth ventricle conſtituted between the Brain and <hi>Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi> But that Cavity which the principal Authors of Anatomy call the fourth ventricle ſeeing it properly belongs to the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> we will ſpeak of it, when we come to it in order of Diſſection.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe Protuberances, ſome are leſſer and proper to the Brain, which are called Teſticles; others greater, and called Buttocks from a certain ſimilitude they bear to thoſe parts: The <hi>Glandula Pinealis</hi> is neer theſe, ſo called becauſe 'tis like a Pine-nut; It is in ſubſtance ſomewhat hard, reddiſh, eaſie to be reſolved, and compaſſed about with a thin Membrane; it is ſet before the hinder paſſage of the third ventricle, to wit, the channel that paſſeth to the beginning of the Marrow of the Back: Now the ſuperior parts of the brain being taken away by Diſſection and drawn to the ſide, the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> appears, and the Baſis of each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the marrow of the back, from whence the Nerves take their common original.</p>
               <p>The Nerves are veſſels of the ſame ſubſtance with the Brain, thin and white Chords (if you except the firſt and ſecond pair) which being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together by the <hi>Meninge,</hi> make long and round Channels, by which the Animal Spirit, which is the Author of ſence and motion, is carried to the ſeveral parts of the Body; they have Veins and Arteries for their nouriſhment and vital heat; they have no Cavity diſcernable to the eyes, ſeing they ſeem to contain a whitiſh marrow within, which both wounds and obſtructions in them ſufficiently manifeſteth, the dilligence of Nature in preſerving them is admirable, for it brings the Nerves to the parts they are appointed for by a certain flexure; as they paſs the holes of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> it defendeth and ſtrengthneth them with a ſeminal ſubſtance, moſt of them make a plexure one with another, and make a ſubſtance like a ſwelling or contraction ere they paſs further, as though they would unite their ſtrength; in their progreſs they are harder.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Nerves which take their original within the Skull, the Nerves of ſmelling come firſt to view; they take their ſlender beginning from the Baſis of the Brain, beyond the hole of the rocky Proceſs, which gives paſſe to the Nerve of the fift pair, and by degrees growing neerer together and thicker, they are extended above the <hi>Os Ethmois:</hi> the Proceſs called <hi>Criſt</hi> paſſing between, they make the ſwelling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes called <hi>Mamillaxes</hi> with their extremities, and theſe in ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whoſe ſmell is ſtrong are larger.</p>
               <p>The next pair are the Optick Nerves which the Ancients held to be the firſt, they are great but ſoft and more porous than the reſt, they take their original backwards, from the beginning of the marrow of the back, where the two legs of the vault are ſtretched out, in the midſt of their journey they are joyned that the ſpirit might more eaſily paſs from one eye to another, then being ſeparated they paſs through each
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40322:67"/> hole of the wedg-like Bone, to the right and left Eye, this pair being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> comes in ſight, being a Membranous Channel like a Funnel, growing narrower by degrees from a broad Baſis, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the redundant flegm to the <hi>Glandula</hi> under it: The <hi>Glandula</hi> it ſelf is called <hi>Pituitaria,</hi> and is placed in the Saddle of the Wedg-like bone, and ſends the moiſture it receives by the holes next to it to the Pallat.</p>
               <p>The ſecond pair of Nerves are thoſe that move the Eyes, and are therefore called <hi>Motorium;</hi> they take their original neer the former: at their beginning they are joyned, afterwards being ſevered, they paſs to the Eyes by the ſecond hole of the Wedg-like Bone, and to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which lifts up the upper Eye-lid, to the <hi>Adductor</hi> and the leſſer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Muſcle; to this we adjoyn that Nerve which is called the leſſer Branch of the fift pair, which coming from the middle Baſis of the Brain, paſſeth to the Muſcle of the Eye called <hi>Abducens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third pair of Nerves takes its original behind from the baſis of the Brain, and in its progreſs is joyned to the former in the hole of the Eye, which when it toucheth it is divided into two branches, whereof one paſſing above the Eye by the bony Channel, or hole of the Forehead, is diſtributed to the upper Eye-lid, the Skin, and the Muſcles of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: The other branch paſſeth under the eye, and proceeding between the two long <hi>Lamens,</hi> and ſending branches both to the tunicle of the Noſtrils, and to the temporal Muſcle, it paſſeth by the hole of the fourth bone of the upper Jaw, to the Muſcles of the upper Lip and others of the Face; ſome call this the firſt branch, ſome the firſt and ſecond of the third pair, which joyns it ſelf to the fourth pair; to this third pair we ad that ſmall Nerve, which ariſing from the Baſis of the Brain neer the prominences which are called Teſticles entring the Apple of the Eye is carried to his Muſcle called <hi>Trochlea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth pair ariſeth from the Baſis of the Brain with the former, but a little before it, and deſcends by the ſixt hole of the Wedg-like bone, and after in its paſſage it hath beſtowed branches upon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle, the internal Alar and the <hi>Buccae,</hi> to the Teeth of the upper Jaw, the Pallat and Gums, it is carried into the internal hole of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Jaw, and gives branches to the roots of the Teeth, and paſſing out again at the external hole of the ſame Cheek, its diſtributed in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior lip and his ſkin, the branch of this pair which remaineth, paſſing by the Muſcles in the mouth, it is diſtributed to the ſides of the Tongue: That ſmall Nerve is nothing elſe but a branch of this pair which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called the fourth pair, thinking it to be a pair by it ſelf, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed in the Pallat and his Tunicle.</p>
               <p>The fift pair ariſeth from the very beginning of the marrow of the Back where it is joyned to the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> it paſſeth the firſt hole of the bones of the Temples; it is of one ſoft ſubſtance, and is the proper organ of Hearing, another harder which paſſeth through the hole called <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> by the Ancients, ſlipping without the Skull between the Dug-like Proceſs, and the Bodkin-like Appendix, and paſſeth to the Muſcles of the Jaw, the ſkin both of the Jaws and Ears: Its Progreſs in the Ears ſee Chap. 16. Fig. 12.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40322:67"/>
               <p>The ſixt pair riſeth a little below the fifth, deſcending by the third hole of the Bone of the Temples, which is common to the hinder part of the Head, and being divided on each ſide into internal and external Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches makes that famous plexure which we ſpake of in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh pair proceeds from the Marrow juſt paſſing out of the Skull, and is harder than the reſt, and ſlips out of the Skull by the fourth and fift holes of the hinder part of the Skull; having paſſed the Skull with its common covering, it joyns its ſelf to the ſixt pair, from which being ſeparated it is diſtributed partly to the Cartilages of the <hi>Hyois,</hi> partly to the Tongue it ſelf, of which ſee Chapter 3. Figure 8. and Chapter 11. Figure 14. The beginnings of the Nerves and the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> being ſeparated out of the Cavity of the Saddle, about the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the brain, that plexure of the <hi>Carotides</hi> and Vertebral Arteries is to be heeded; Ancient Writers called it <hi>Retiformis,</hi> but Modern <hi>Rete Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile,</hi> than which, a ruder expreſſion in the brain of man admits no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſion. Its uſe is the ſame with the <hi>Plexus Chorois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cerebellum</hi> is a ſollid body if you compare it with the Brain, and is divided into two parts like Globes, between which the two Proceſſes called <hi>Vermi formis</hi> appear, to which about the hinder part of the Trunks of the marrow of the Back, a third is ſeen, which <hi>Varolius</hi> calls the Bridg of the Brain, although this be not alwaies ſimple, but ſometimes unequal with certain bunches ſticking up.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cerebellum</hi> being turned over with the Brain, and that portion of the marrow of the back annexed to it, the globes of the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> being gently drawn aſide, in the baſis of them appears a Cavity which the beſt <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> call the fourth ventricle, <hi>Herophylus</hi> calls it the principal ventricle, <hi>Arantius</hi> the <hi>Ciſtern:</hi> Its compaſs is round, yet ſomething broad, and diſtinguiſhed with two Cavities, at the entrance of it, where the Cavity of the marrow of the back is, the worm-like proceſs hangs over it, and a thin Membrane is drawn over it, in it, the purer air drawn out of the former ventricles, is kept for the refreſhing of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Marrow of the Back depends upon both Brain and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a doubled Trunk of them both, from whence it paſſeth down the large Cavities of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> which ſerve like a ſheath for it, and ſends out Nerves which are diſtributed to the whol Body; it is covered with two Membranes as the brain is, but in its progreſs is of a harder ſubſtance: it hath veins and arteries diſtributed to it through the holes of the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> that it may be furniſhed with Blood and vital Spirit; about its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning as we told you, it is manifeſtly divided and gives a round Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which ends in a poynt by degrees, diſtinguiſhed by a ſmall chink which <hi>Herophilus</hi> compares to a writing pen; It is joyned by degrees in its progreſs; to external view it is ſingle, but conſidered in its ſelf it is manifold, and divided into almoſt innumerable ſmall Nerves, more or fewer, of which the Membrane encompaſſing collects into one branch, and diſtributes into pairs through ſo many holes of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>

               <p>In the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck are ſeven pair, which are diſtributed to the Muſcles of the Head Neck and Shoulders, Arms and Hands, of which in the laſt Chapter: The Marrow of the Back hath twelve pair, dedicated to the Membranes of the Breaſt, Back, and Muſcles of the Ribs: The Loyns have five pair; the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> ſix, which ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the laſt Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 15.</hi> Of the <hi>EYES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMongſt all the external Sences, the Sight carries the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which is ſeated in the cleer Orbs of the Eyes, which the Ancients rightly called the windows of the mind whereby it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth its viſible part, and the fire-brands of Love.</p>
               <p>The Eye-lids are firſt of all to be viewed, which are the coverings of the Eyes, without them they have a thin ſkin but no fat, within they are covered with the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> a fleſhy Membrane intercedes theſe, with which two Muſcles which are the ſhutters too of the Eye-lids are intertexed, which we mentioned in the thirteenth Chapter; alſo the Muſcle which lifts up the ſuperior Eye-lid, which takes its beginning within the Eye, about the hole of the Optick Nerve, and being dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from a thin and fleſhy beginning, it ends in the brim of the ſaid Eye-lid with a broad and ſubtil Tendon: Their extremities are Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, which Cartilages the Greeks call <hi>Tharſos;</hi> for their more firm ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and for their exact cloſure they have a ſmall Muſcle.</p>
               <p>When they are open they make two angles, which the ancients called <hi>Canthi,</hi> the one on the outſide which is leſs, neer which, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Eye lies a famous <hi>Glandula,</hi> the internal corner is larger,
<pb facs="tcp:40322:72"/>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40322:72"/> within which lies a ſpongy Caruncle, and ſoft, neer the Bone of the Noſe, which ſtops the flowing of tears by the Noſtrils; and for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe is called <hi>Lacrymalis;</hi> in the Cartilaginous brims of the Eye-lids, about the greater angle are two ſmall holes, a callous lightly hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, which are called <hi>Puncta Lacrimalia,</hi> becauſe if you put a Hogs briſtle into them they produce tears, they are moſt conſpicuous in great Beaſts, and Men that are prone to weep. But how comes it to paſs you will ſay that tears are ſo rife and ready in time of grief? Truly, not from the Eyes, but from the Brain, by the ſecond hole of the wedg-like bone, alſo from the top and ſides of the Head they flow to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned holes; hence it comes to paſs that the ſkin between the external angle of the Eye, and the <hi>Helice</hi> of the Ear, together with the panicle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it being wounded, much watry ſubſtance iſſues out, and continual weeping againſt ones will inſtantly ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>To the extremity of the Eye-lids are hairs inſerted, growing out ſtraight, and when they are grown to their natural length, ceaſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; theſe not only keep ſmall bodges which fly in the air from getting into the Eye, but alſo by giving a gentle ſhadow they make the ſight the more piercing; but this famous uſe is loſt ſo often as theſe hairs are thicker than naturally they ſhould be, and when they are turned inward and prick the Eyes.</p>
               <p>The office of the Eye-lids is conſpicuous, <hi>Viz.</hi> to moiſten the Eyes, to open, ſhut and defend them, and their office is of ſo great neceſſity Nature will perform, when we are ſo far from willing of it, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of it, for it is very rare to forbear winking when any thing threatens.</p>
               <p>To the confines of the Eyes and Forehead, hath the Divine Creator produced the Eye-brows, being a thick ſkin ſticking out, and rough with hair, not ſo much for beauty ſake and to ſhadow the Eye, as to keep the ſweat which falls down from the Forehead out of them.</p>
               <p>But the Eyes themſelves which are the organs of Sight, are variouſly furniſhed with veſſels, Muſcles, Membranes and Humors: of the Veins ſome are external and viſible on the white of the Eye, other ſome are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and hidden; the external veins proceed from the external bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Jugulars; the internal, which accompany the optick Nerve from the internal Jugulars, and are helped by the <hi>Plexus Choroides.</hi> The original of the Arteries is not unlike this, the interior of which ariſe from the exterior Branch of the <hi>Carotides;</hi> the internal come from the <hi>Carotides,</hi> where with the Vertebrals they make the <hi>Rete Mirabile;</hi> hence it comes to paſs that in external provocations the blood being mingled with Spirit the Eyes look red, and ſometimes are inflamed: they have diverſe Nerves, the moſt famous of which, is the Optick Nerve, which carries the viſive vertue to the Eye, and by its expanſion, or opening a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of its own ſubſtance, ſeems to beſtow a three-fold Tunicle upon the Eyes; the next to this is leſs, which with the two ſmall Nerves its companions, diſtributes its Branches to the two Muſcles of the Eyes, which are called <hi>Motorii</hi> from their office, which we diſcourſed of in the foregoing Chaprer.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40322:73"/>
               <p>The bigneſs of the Eyes in a Man grown up is mean; in number they are two, that ſo when the one is hurt the common office might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the other, and yet their conſent is admirable, ſo that the one being hurt by internal cauſes againſt Nature, the other is hurt alſo, or elſe grows weaker, or is blood-ſhot. If we look upon their qualities by reaſon of their contained humors, they are cold and moiſt, and yet this is wonderfully leſned by the copious influx of heat and Spirits, by ſo many veſſels, whereby waxing hotter than a natural mean, they not only infect Looking-glaſſes being held neer them, but alſo other mens Eyes with the ſame diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Eyes have light in themſelves, and a certain Splendor not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the humors but alſo in the Membranes; indeed this is but mean in Man, becauſe the actions God hath ordained for him are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the day time, but it is greater in ſuch living creatures as get their food by night, the inbred light of whoſe Eyes overcomes the darkneſs round about them; there is ſcarce another part of mans Body that gives more manifeſt ſigns of health and ſickneſs than the Eyes do: In a man that is in health, they are full and bright; in a Man that is ill, they are ſunk, ſad, troubled, or obſcure, till death hath overcome Nature, that they fail in ſtrength and ſight, and give warning of changing this life for another. Laſtly, Conſider that the Ancients were perſwaded that the whol force of the mind was inſiſted in the Eyes, and that there was no Beaſt ſo fierce, but if his Eyes were covered would be milder.</p>
               <p>Their figure ought to be round, not ſo much that they might move the eaſier, as that they might receive viſible objects the better; they carry the ſame form the Stars do, that by them we may meaſure their riſing and ſitting, and therefore it was a cuſtom amongſt the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> to carry men that were neer death out into the air that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Heavens: The wiſe Creator hath placed them in a high and ſtrong hole of the Skull; high, that they might perform their office of watchfulneſs the better, and ſtrong amongſt the Bones that they might be the better defended from wrong.</p>
               <p>But that we may the better know their actions, we will view, firſt their Muſcles, then their Membranes, and laſt of all, their Humors; the Muſcles which move the Eyes of Man, are ſix in number, which have fat about them to defend them from the injury of coldneſs and drineſs: Of theſe, ſuch are called <hi>Recti</hi> as perform the right motions of the Eyes; ſome are called Oblique, whoſe magnitude and thickneſs is almoſt equal with the right; they take their beginning from that internal bone, about the large holes which admit the Nerves, and are carried under that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle called <hi>Annata,</hi> to that which is called <hi>Cornea;</hi> theſe are four in number, of which, the firſt lifts up the Eye, and is called <hi>Superbus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe proud people uſually go with their Eyes elevated: The next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the firſt depreſſeth the Eye, which action becauſe it is a note of modeſty, the Muſcle is called <hi>Humilis:</hi> The third draweth the Eye right to the inner angle, and is called <hi>Bibitorius,</hi> becauſe when people drink they turn their Eyes inward that they may look in the Cup: The
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40322:73"/> fourth draws the Eye to the external angle, and is called <hi>Indignatorius,</hi> becauſe men lear on that faſhion when they are angery; theſe are the right Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The Oblique Muſcles are two, and are called <hi>Amatorii,</hi> becauſe the glances of the Eyes intice Lovers; Of theſe, that which is leſs and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Scituation, riſeth in that place; the firſt Bone of the Jaw, is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the fourth in extream part of the inferior <hi>Orbita.</hi> It aſcends obliquely upwards towards the outward angle of the Eye-lid, and paſſeth with a ſhort Tendon to the <hi>Iris,</hi> and turns the Eye obliquely downwards, towards the outward angle; the other oblique Muſcle which is called the greater, is longer and higher in Scituation, and hath the ſame beginning with the third of the right Muſcles, neer the internal angle of the Eye, it enters the Cartilaginous <hi>Trochlea,</hi> with a thin begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from whence paſſing obliquely, by the ſuperior part of the Eye, it ends neer the end of the oblique Tendon of the inferior Muſcle, and turns the Eye about towards the internal angle.</p>
               <p>The Membranes which include the Eye are common and proper; The firſt of the common is called <hi>Adnata</hi> or <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> neither is it any thing elſe than the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> ſpread abroad to the Eye-lids, and white of the Eye. The other is called <hi>Innominata,</hi> and ſeems to be nothing elſe but a ſubtil expanſion of the Tendons and Muſcles, eſpecially the right ones, and is produced to the circumference of the <hi>Iris</hi> or <hi>Cornea Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of the proper Membranes is called <hi>Sclerotes,</hi> or hard, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its thickneſs and habit; on the fore part which is tranſparent it is called <hi>Cornea,</hi> becauſe in cleerneſs it reſembles a thin Horn; it ſticks ſomething out on the fore part.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of the proper Membranes is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea;</hi> on the fore part it is far thinner than the former, and hath diverſe colours, behind it hath a certain black ſmootineſs; that this is requiſite for the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſight, is probable by this Argument, Becauſe in the <hi>Embrion</hi> in the Womb, even before the Eys are cover'd w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Eye-lids, it is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Nature of a blackiſh color, manifeſting it ſelf through the <hi>Scelotes;</hi> that portion of it which is tranſparent through the <hi>Cornea,</hi> is called <hi>Iris,</hi> by reaſon of its variety of colours; it hath a manifeſt hole in it called <hi>Pupil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> through which, as through a window, it diſcerns the Species of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects: It is free from any nexure both before and behind, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Circumference of the <hi>Cornea;</hi> being firmly joyned to the bounds of the <hi>Sclerotes,</hi> it makes that Ligament which Authors call <hi>Ciliare,</hi> from which according to the latitude of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> towards the Chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line humor, certain ſmall ſtrings run like black lines, like the hair of the Eye-lids; by their help the hole of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> is contracted and dilated, and the Chriſtalline humor it ſelf ſuffers gentle motion.</p>
               <p>The remaining and greater part of the ſecond Membrane, which compaſſeth about the hinder part, and ſides of the Eye, and where it is knit to the <hi>Sclerotes</hi> is called <hi>Choroides,</hi> both becauſe it compaſſeth the Eye, and becauſe it is endewed with not a few ſmal veins; and as the Al-wiſe Creator made the Corneal Tunicle cleer, that ſo the viſible object might
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40322:74"/> touch the internal or illuminated part of the Eyes, ſo he made the ſecond Membrane opacous, that the viſible Image being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Eye, might be the more cleer by the ſhadow round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>The third of the Membranes is called <hi>Retiformis,</hi> or <hi>Amphibleſtroides;</hi> It is ſoft and of a Mucous ſubſtance; it obtained its name, becauſe being put into the water it is like a little Net: It is ſtretched from the very centre of the Optick Nerve above the vital humor, even to the Ciliar Ligament.</p>
               <p>The fourth Membrane is called <hi>Chriſtalina,</hi> and compaſſeth the Chryſtalline humor before, and is as thin as a Cobweb, and was therefore called <hi>Aranea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift and laſt Membrane is called, <hi>Vitrea,</hi> embracing the Vitreal Humor, famous both for its lightneſs and thinneſs; in the Eyes of Living Creatures being made thick by a gentle boyling, both this and the former may be diſcerned from the humor they contain in them.</p>
               <p>The Humors of the Eyes come now in play, which are in number three; the <hi>Aqueal, Chryſtalline,</hi> and <hi>Vitreal;</hi> all of them cleer and void of any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that the Idea of viſible things which have colours may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Of the Humors, the Aqueal is the firſt, thinneſt, and moſt fluid, moiſtning the Chriſtalline humor, and that part of the Vitreal which is next it; it is diſtributed as well within as without the Uveal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane: It is gathered before within the <hi>Cornea,</hi> behind by the Chriſtalline and Vitreal Tunicle, and comprehended with the Ciliar Ligament.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtalline humor excels the reſt by far in ſoliddity, cleerneſs, and ſplendor: It is produced by Nature from a cleer portion of the Seed, and makes the very Fundamental of the Eyes, ſo that they err that think it to be void of heat and ſpirit, and alſo of true nouriſhment, for its original is of Seed, and it encreaſeth like other parts: It is in form like a little lentil, of a compreſſed roundneſs, in what part it looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> and is next the Aqueal humor; that ſide of it which lies in the Cavity of the Vitreal humor, is beheld in a longer Sphear; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this alwaies ſo, for ſometimes the fore part is moſt globous, the hinder part more obtuſe, and ſometimes both ſides are alike: It is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midſt of the Eye, yet ſo as it ſticks out moſt on the fore ſide.</p>
               <p>The Vitreal humor is greater than the other two, and is like melted glaſs, not only in ſubſtance, but alſo in bright colour; it occupies all the Cavity of the Eye that is left by the other two; behind, and on both ſides it is round; before, it hath a Cavity, in which is placed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor.</p>
               <p>The action of the Eyes is Sight; in which, if you regard the expreſſion of the viſible Species within the Eye, the Chriſtalline Humor hath the preheminence: If you regard the ſenſibility of this expreſſion, then the optick Nerve and the expanſion of it by the Net-like Tunicle hath the preheminence.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40322:76"/>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40322:76"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. 16.</hi> Of the <hi>EARES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>EVen as the Eyes conduce to the pleaſure of the life of Mortals, for the uſe of the light, and are therefore moſt precious parts of the Body, Even ſo the Organs of Hearing are excellent for the learning of Wiſdom and Diſcipline: Of theſe, ſome parts are manifeſt to the Eyes, and others hidden within the holes of the <hi>Os Petroſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manifeſt part of this Organ they call the Ear, <hi>Auricula,</hi> and more diſtinctly the external Ear: This conſiſts of diverſe parts, of ſkin, ſome ſmall fat, and a fleſhy Membrane underneath, but properly of a Cartilage, a lobe, and private veſſels: The Cartilage is the uppermoſt and largeſt portion of the external Ear, that the paſſage of Hearing may be kept open night and day: Its Cavities and Productions are not eaſily beaten out of play, for by their ſoft bowing, they yeild to the Head when it lies down, and to other external things, but eſpecially they force the ſound they receive ſtrongly inwards.</p>
               <p>A ſoft ſubſtance occupies the inferior part which is called <hi>Lobus;</hi> it is more like fat than fleſh, and in this, being pierced through, people wear Jewels: Women in old time uſed to lay out more coſt in nothing than in Pearls to hang in their Ears; neither are the <hi>Arabian</hi> Women leſs mad who hang huge Rings there, and hold it a grace alſo to wear ſuch in the ſides of their Noſes.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:40322:77"/>
               <p>Theſe parts have Veins from the external and internal Jugulars, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from each <hi>Carotis</hi> and two Nerves, produced eſpecially from the ſecond pair of the marrow of the Neck, to which a ſmall branch is to be added from the hard portion of the fift pair, which paſſeth by the hole called <hi>Caecum,</hi> and theſe creep along the ſides and lower part of the Ear.</p>
               <p>Nay, leaſt any thing ſhould be wanting to the perfection of this noble Sence in Man, the Divine <hi>Creator</hi> hath placed two Muſcles about the Cartilage we ſpake of, which for their ſingular thinneſs <hi>Galen</hi> calls <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphius</hi> or Linaments of Muſcles, expreſſed in the Membrane under the fat, with a Fleſhy fibrous intertexture, ſometimes more plainly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more obſcurely, that that being ſtretched out, ſo often as we would hearken attentively, and the lower part of the Ear being gently drawn back; by the help of theſe Muſcles it paſſes more directly to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the <hi>Timpanum:</hi> Of theſe, that which moves the Cartilage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, being placed upon the temporal Muſcle, deſcends next the external beginning of the Muſcle of the Forehead, and growing narrower by degrees; it ends in the Ear, in the upper part of it: Thoſe which move the Ear obliquely upwards and backwards, are held to be five; amongſt which, moſt commonly with that which went before, that is numbred, ariſing from the Muſcles of the hinder part of the Head, paſſeth Tranſverſly downwards above the Dug-like proceſs, and ſticks to the root of the Cartilage, ſometimes with two, ſometimes with three diſtinct Tendons.</p>
               <p>The magnitude of the external Ear of Man is but ſmall, and eaſily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the Hair: In reſpect of its diſpoſition, it is cold and dry: In figure it is almoſt oval, yet not without various protuberances, of which that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> makes the extream brim of it for its wreathed flexure is called <hi>Helix,</hi> the next which is inner and anſwers to the firſt is called <hi>Anthelix:</hi> the eminences which behold the Temples and are rougheſt with hairs, in ſome they have a thick tuft like a Goats beard, is called <hi>Tragus,</hi> and that oppoſite to it <hi>Antitragus.</hi> The Cavities of the Ears are three, the one interior, which is the Portal of the paſſage of Hearing; the other is drawn about this, and from its ſimilitude to a Shell, called <hi>Concha:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Helix</hi> and <hi>Anthelix,</hi> is a third comprehended, for which, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are yet to ſeek of a name. The moſt wiſe Creator hath placed the ears in the upper part of the Body, becauſe the air ſooneſt carries ſounds upwards: The Cartilage is joyned to the <hi>Os Petroſum</hi> by a ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is produced from the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> the reſt is joyned to the Body by the Tendons of the Muſcles, and the common coverings.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the Ears is not the ornament of the Head, nor yet to hang Jewels in, although Nature hath left certain footſteps of a hole in each <hi>Lobus,</hi> nor yet the defence of the Brain which is ſufficiently defended by its own proper muniments, but that the aerial ſound being collected and received by ſo many Cavities, may more directly paſs to the internal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Ear, and therefore although this external Ear be wanting in very many living Creatures, yet it is palpable by this, that in man it conduceth to the perfection of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe ſuch as have loſt their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40322:77"/> Ears (not for their honeſty) or have them mutilated by cold, or the Cavities ſtoppped whereby detriment comes to the hearing, they remedy it by holding the Cavity of their Hand over their Ear.</p>
               <p>Theſe are very many <hi>Glandulae</hi> about the Ear, which drink up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant humor, and underprop the veſſels, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by reaſon of their neerneſs, calls <hi>Parotides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that internal and true Organ of Hearing, is placed in the rocky Proceſs of the Bone of the Temples, being not only ſafe by reaſon of its hardneſs, againſt the violence of external injuries, but alſo the fitter to retain the ſound by reaſon of its dryneſs: Its Cavities and turnings are very many; four are eſpecially related by the Authors of Diſſections which have relation to the uſe of Hearing, namely the paſſage of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Timpanum, Labyrinthus,</hi> and <hi>Cochlea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The paſſage of Hearing beginning from the <hi>Concha</hi> of the external Ear, is cloathed with a thin ſkin and a Membrane with ſome fat, and with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> even to the borders of the <hi>Timpanum:</hi> It hath a wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed paſſage turning ſomething upwards, that ſo things which outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into it, may not come to the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> and corruption gathered within it may the readier be carried out: In the paſſage of hearing is a viſcous humor gathered, yellowiſh in colour and bitteriſh in taſt, which is a preſent remedy for wounds and ulcers; the Ancients called it <hi>Ceru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and the place it ſelf in which it is found the <hi>Hive</hi> of the Ears, and we in <hi>England</hi> call it <hi>Ear-wax:</hi> It hath its uſe, for ſuch things as creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ears, are intangled in it, as it were in <hi>Bird-lime,</hi> and ſo offended with its bitterneſs that they cannot paſs to the <hi>Timpanum.</hi> In the end of the paſſage of Hearing is a Membrane, which the Ancient Greeks called by the common Name <hi>Meninge,</hi> or the <hi>Lymen</hi> of the Ear, but Modern Anatomiſts, by reaſon of that eminent Cavity which is neer it, call it the Membrane of the <hi>Timpanum;</hi> it is the internal covering of the Ear and very thin, yet by reaſon of its ſingular clammineſs, it is a Nervous Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firm enough, that it not only ſuſtains the external force of the air without any prejudice, but by its drineſs preſerves the Species of the ſound, and ſends it into the internal Cavities of the Ear; it ſeems to be but an expanſion of the <hi>Perioſtion,</hi> which being ſeparated, that is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo; it is exquiſite in ſence, both by reaſon of the Nerves that are diſtributed in it, and that paſs under it, ſometimes it is double, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the excrements being thick and ſticking to it like a cruſt, brings no ſmall prejudice to the Hearing: It looks down right from an oblique Scituation, whereby it is ſafer from outward violence, and apter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the image of voyce; it ſticks firmly to the little bone which is called <hi>Mullens,</hi> and to the Cavity of the <hi>Orbita</hi> next to it, if you except but that part which toucheth the ſuperior region of the paſſage of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for there the connexion is looſer, ſo that the Membrane may be a little opened.</p>
               <p>For in the ſuperier and internal Cavity of the paſſage of Hearing, the provident Creator hath placed a Muſcle intertexed with the Membrane growing to the skin, and this is ſeen not only in men grown up, but alſo continually in Infants, which here by its thin ſubſtance of fleſhy <hi>fibrae</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:40322:78"/> growing narrower from a broad beginning, with a ſubtil Tendon tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Membrane of the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> is carried even to the <hi>Malleolus,</hi> that the Membrane being ſtretched a little outwards and upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuperior part, the ſound may be the righter taken and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveied to the innermoſt part of the Ear.</p>
               <p>This Membrane being taken away, a large Cavity appears, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rightly calls <hi>Antroſa,</hi> by reaſon of the various Cavities into which it is diffuſed: <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls it <hi>Timpanum,</hi> becauſe the Membrane is placed round about the edges of it, like a Drum-head: He that would view this accuratly, muſt firſt take away the three ſmall bones placed in it; they are diſtitute of Membranes, and yet about their extremities, they are bound with a ſlender Ligament for their firmer nexure, the firſt of theſe from the likeneſs of its form they call <hi>Malleolus,</hi> it hath a round head from which by degrees it is attenuated, about the middle it is adorned with two proceſſes, one of which is ſhort, to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Muſcle joyns it ſelf; the other is longer but thinner, which lies upon the roundneſs of the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> the remainder of the little bone whether you compare it to a little foot or to a tail, its extremity being a little turned inwards, lightly turns the Membrane ſticking to it, about the middle; its head is joyned to the <hi>Anvil</hi> placed to it, by ſuch a nexure as is not very ſtraight by reaſon of the looſneſs of the Ligament: It is more ſtrongly joyned to the Membrane under it, for the ſafeguard and motion of which, the <hi>Moleolus</hi> is framed.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that to the exquiſite tranſmiſſion of ſound, it is not ſufficient to unfold the Membrane of the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> a little outwards, but alſo to conſider the reſt of the Dimenſions; The wiſe Creator hath produced a Muſcle, which is very little, but in exactneſs of all parts equal with the greateſt, and hath ſecured it in a ſingular paſſage of the <hi>Os Petroſum:</hi> It takes its beginning like a Ligament, at what part the ſtony proceſs is joyned to the Wedg-like Bone, and growing thicker by degrees, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth commonly with a double, ſometimes with a ſingle Tendon, to the ſhorter proceſs of the <hi>Malleolus</hi> and its Neck, and therefore the bone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved inwards toward the forepart, it draws the Membrane of the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> which is annexed to it inwards alſo.</p>
               <p>The other of the little Bones of Hearing, obtains the name of <hi>Anvil,</hi> and is of a thicker body; this hath a light Cavity, in which, the head of the <hi>Malleolus</hi> is received; as alſo two Proceſſes, of which, the ſhorter leans to the hinder Cavity of the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> the other is longer, and is firmly, though looſly, bound by a Ligament to the head of the <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo the third ſmall Bone of the <hi>Timpanum</hi> is called <hi>Stapes,</hi> or a <hi>Stirrop,</hi> from its figure, it hath a round head, which, as we told you, was knit to the <hi>Anvill,</hi> it ſtretcheth out from its head two Cavities, and a little log bowed like a bow, with a very thin and porous Baſis, leaſt any thing ſhould ſtop the paſſage of the ſound; this anſwers in likeneſs to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of of the oval hole, to which it is bound with a looſe bond, ſo that it may be driven within its Cavity but cannot be pulled out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence, and theſe two ſmall bones are formed for the <hi>Malleolus</hi> ſake
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40322:78"/> that they may conveniently underprop it and be obſervant to its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To the Stirrop is added a fourth little bone, round and ſmall, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Ligament of the <hi>Stirrop,</hi> which <hi>Francis Sylvius</hi> is ſaid firſt to have found out.</p>
               <p>Now the Cavity it ſelf which is called <hi>Timpanum</hi> comes to view, and preſents a various face to them that behold it, for it hath many Cavities and turnings, in which the violent conflux of air is diverted, and the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the voyce hindred by its ſingular inequality; alſo it hath diverſe pores and paſſages which tranſmit the images of ſounds: above, where the ſhorter Proceſs of the <hi>Anvil</hi> is, a large Den is opened, which by its ſmal Caverns opens a way into the inexplicable hollowneſs of the Dug-like Proceſs: Beneath, and toward the fore part, there is a paſſage from the <hi>Timpanum</hi> to the Pallat, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is narrower toward the end by reaſon of the acceſs of Cartilages, by which the ſound being as it were ſtirred up in the mouth with the air, paſſeth to the Ear, ſo alſo the humidities againſt Nature are caſt out by the pallat, and that is the reaſon ſuch as are dull of hearing, hear better their mouths being open, and breathing reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but when they yawn they are altogether deaf; and although the outward Ear be altogether ſtopped, yet they percive their own ſpeech well enough; neither can any other reaſon be given, why the mouth and noſtrils being ſtopped that <hi>Membrana</hi> of the <hi>Timpanum</hi> is turned out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a ſound, and if the violence be the greater it is hurt by it, and by this paſſage ſome will avoid the ſmoke of <hi>Tobacco</hi> which they take, out at their Ears: Alſo <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> held that Goats alſo breathed by their Ears, the air and what is mixed with it, ſo readily running from the Pallat to the <hi>Timpanum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The middle of the antrous Cavity which ſticks up like a little ſmooth hill, hath a hole on each ſide, of which, that which is greateſt and ſhut with the thin and cleer Baſis of the <hi>Stirrop,</hi> they call the <hi>Oval window;</hi> that which is leſs they call the <hi>Round window;</hi> the one deduceth the ſound to the labirinth, the other to the beginning of the <hi>Cochlea;</hi> at the end of this, more ſmall pores are ſeen.</p>
               <p>The oval Window looks into another Cavity far leſs than the former, which by reaſon of its bony paſſages returning into the ſame Cavity, <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls the <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> its compaſs is round, and beſides that oval hole which is over it, it hath four holes of its own which end in periods, and a fift which opens it ſelf in the end of the broader circle of the <hi>Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea:</hi> Theſe the following Table ſufficiently manifeſteth, but the <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> whol with its circles and the <hi>Cochlea,</hi> the Table of the eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſecond, ſeventh, and eight Figure repreſents.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cochlea</hi> is a famous Cavity of the Ear, with two circles and a third portion bowed like a ſpoon; it is placed in the common rocky proceſs, it is ſpermatical, dry, and light, of a ſubſtance fit to preſerve the ſound.</p>
               <p>In theſe abſtruſe Cavities air is contained even from the very birth; to this hidden Organ of Hearing are ſmall Veins and Arteries diſtributed from the internal and foremoſt branches of the Jugular Vein and <hi>Carotis</hi> Artery, but eſpecially Nerves; for whereas a double portion of the fift
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40322:79"/> pair is carried into the poſterior paſſage of the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> or firſt hole of the Bone of the Temples, one is harder, which enters the hole called by the Ancients <hi>Caecum,</hi> and paſſeth the Skul, by a wreathed paſſage; the other is ſofter and divided from the former by a proceſs in the bony paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, this paſſeth by its greater part to the Centre of the <hi>Cochlea,</hi> by its leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to the circles of the <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> in both places it perfects the office of hearing: to theſe a ſingular branch from the fourth Conjugation adds its ſelf, and paſſeth to the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> from the internal part of the Ear, from whence paſſing out it divides its ſelf and partly joyns it ſelf to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der portion of the fift pair, partly it is diſtributed to the Caverns of the Dug-like Proceſs.</p>
               <p>From this the Membranes have ſence, and the internal Muſcle its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in this part of the Organ of Hearing, if it be demanded which is chiefeſt and moſt neceſſary to hearing, we muſt make ſome diſtinction, for if we regard that part which retains the ſound, and ſends it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, the <hi>Cochlea</hi> will gain the preheminence, but if we ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what is required to the perceiving of the ſound received, the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſoft Nerve placed in the circulation of the <hi>Cochlea</hi> will have the dignity.</p>
               <p>After the Sences of Seeing and Hearing, there is no reaſon we ſhould treat of the Organs of Smelling, Taſting, and Feeling, for the Noſtrils are the Inſtruments of Smelling, the Bones and Muſcles of which we treated of in the thirteeth Chapter, eſpecially of the Nerves of Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the fourteenth Chapter. The Tongue is the Organ of Taſting, of whoſe ſubſtance, Muſcles, and Veſſels, we writ copiouſly in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter: The Feeling is common to all the parts that have Nerves, or their Branches or Membranes, and hath no particular Organ of its own.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 17.</hi> Of the Bones of the Extream Parts.</head>
               <p>FRom the Trunk of the Body of Man we come to his Limbs, from the Middle Parts to the Extream, to the contemplation of the Hands and Feet, both by the Order of Nature and of Diſſection. Theſe are the Supporters of the whol Body, the other the Stewards and Storers of it; The Limbs have ſtrong Bones, ſtout Muſcles, and very many Veſſels, for their Life, Nouriſhment, and Motion ſake.</p>
               <p>The Bones which are commonly aſſigned to the Hand, are the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Cubits, and ſuch as are proper to the extremity of the Hand; the Bones of the Shoulder, are, the <hi>Claviculae</hi> and <hi>Scapulae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Claviculae</hi> make one Bone on each ſide, fiſtulous and thick, more bowed in Men than they are in Women: One of the Extremities of it is joyned to the <hi>Sternum,</hi> the other with the ſuperior Proceſs of the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> where it produceth the <hi>Acromium</hi> or the top of the Shoulder: Its nexure is looſe, but with a very ſtout Ligament and ſtrengthned with Cartilages.</p>
               <p>The Bone called <hi>Scapula</hi> is broad, and thin; not ſo much for the defence of the Coſtals of the Back, over which it lies like a Buckler, as for the ſafe articulation or joynting of the <hi>Clavicula</hi> and Shoulder: It is in form triangular, by its longeſt ſide ſtretched out in the Baſis, with which the other two being unequal in length, make two angles, the one ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, the other inferior: It is hollow within, gibbous without. It ſends forth a threefold Proceſs, of which, one toucheth the top of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and is called the Spine of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> by reaſon of its figure: It is knit to the <hi>Claricula:</hi> The other is lower and leſs, not much unlike a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Bill, and therefore called <hi>Coracoides:</hi> The third is ſhorter, within whoſe Cavity the head of the Shoulder with its Cartilage is hid. To theſe come their proper additions, as ſingular Ligaments by which the <hi>Scapula</hi> is joyned to the head of the Shoulder, and alſo to the <hi>Clavicula;</hi> theſe are in number reputed to be five, the firſt of which is broader than the reſt, and ſprings from the ſhorter Proceſs encompaſſing the whol joynt, and is ſtrongly faſtened to the firſt and internal region of the head of the Shoulder: The ſecond is famous for ſtrength, produced from the external ſide of the Proceſs <hi>Coracois,</hi> and is inſerted inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Acromium.</hi> The third Ligament is round, and takes its original externally from the Proceſs <hi>Coracois,</hi> and ends internally in the head of the Shoulder. The fourth begins above from the Neck of the <hi>Scapula;</hi> and joyns it ſelf externally to the head of the Shoulder. The fifth hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40322:82"/> the ſame beginning with the former, and ends behind about the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal head of the Shoulder; and theſe Ligaments as they regard the ſtrength of the Shoulder, ſo the third, fourth, and fifth, are fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Tendons of the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>We come now to the Bone of the Shoulder which is large and ſtrong: It hath a great head defended with a Cartilage above: It hath a cleft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, into which the Tendinous beginning of the Muſcle <hi>Biceps</hi> deſcends for its greater ſafeguard and ſtrength; it is knit to the <hi>Scapula</hi> by <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis,</hi> or articulation; the Shoulder is globous before, depreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: the ſuperior part of the Shoulder hath alwaies a manifeſt <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> to the inferior part ſticks out with two Proceſſes eſpecially, of which the external gives beginnings to the Muſcles of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> and thoſe that extend the fingers; at the other, thoſe of the Wreſt, and thoſe that bow the Fingers have their beginning: To theſe comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prominence outwards, for the more commodious bowing of the <hi>Radius:</hi> Here are two Cavities, behold of which, the foremoſt is leaſt, the hindmoſt greateſt, about which the Arm is turned. The <hi>Cubitus</hi> is compoſed of a double Bone, which are joyned together at the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſeparated in the middle, where notwithſtanding they are joyned by a Membranous Ligament, that the motion might be the readier, and alſo that the Muſcles might be the ſafer.</p>
               <p>The firſt bone of the <hi>Cubitus</hi> is called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> becauſe it is often uſed to meaſure things with, for of old, it was only called <hi>Os Cubiti,</hi> as the Bone of the Shoulder was called the Arm; this is larger than the other, and longer, and attenuated by degrees from the Back; above, it hath two Proceſſes, one which is leſs and more acute, which is the foremoſt; the greater is more obtuſe, which is the hindmoſt, and by the Ancients is called <hi>Ancon</hi> and <hi>Olecranon.</hi> Two Cavities are to be added to theſe, of which, the exterior and leſſer receives the head of the <hi>Radius:</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is larger and ſemicircular, by which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> is joyned to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by that articulation which the Greeks call <hi>Ginglymos:</hi> the inferior part of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> ends in a round knob, which is called <hi>Styloides,</hi> and by the intervening of Cartilages is knit by a ligament to the Bones of the Wreſt.</p>
               <p>The other Bone of the <hi>Cubitus</hi> is called <hi>Radius,</hi> and is the higher in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and the ſhorter, and having a round head, is received by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> although by a ſingular Cavity it receive the Bone of the Shoulder; at the other extremity is thicker and by a leſſer Cavity receives the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> by a greater the Bone of the Wreſt.</p>
               <p>The Hand is divided into three parts, <hi>Carpus, Metacarpus,</hi> and the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: The <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wreſt is formed of eight ſmall Bones, ſomething different the one from the other, both in magnitude and form; four of theſe are placed beneath, ſo many are joyned to the Bones of the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi> by <hi>Synarthroſis;</hi> four are ſuperior, of which, three are joyned to the <hi>Cubitus</hi> and <hi>Radius,</hi> they are joyned by a Cartilaginous Ligament, and by another Tranſverſe one, which as it defends the Bones of the Wreſt, ſo it conſtrains the Tendons of the Muſcles to ſtretch out the Fingers.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:40322:82"/>
               <p>The <hi>Metacarpus</hi> is compoſed of four Bones, long and ſlender, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the middle, that ſo the Muſcles may lie the ſafer between the Bones, and their waight may not hinder the agility of the Hand: they have broad Apendices beneath, into the Cavities of which the Bones of the Wreſt paſs; the ſuperior are round, that they may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the orders of the Fingers.</p>
               <p>Fifteen Bones, which are diverſe in reſpect of magnitude, make up the Fingers, if you reckon the Thumb and all, for the firſt in the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers is larger than the ſecond, and the ſecond than the third, which is covered with the Nail; externally they are all round, internally plain, that ſo we might graſp ſollid things the eaſier: beneath they have broad Proceſſes, in the Cavity of which they receive others; above they have round Proceſſes received within the Cavities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Foot makes up the other Extream part, under which common name is comprehended the Thigh, Leg, and that which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Foot. The Bone of each Thigh is but one, but in ſtrength and bigneſs ſecond to none, becauſe it is to ſuſtain the whol bulk of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it is round before, but ſomething compreſſed behind, and hath a rough thing like a line, ſtretched obliquely towards the lower part for the more ready commiſſion of the knees: It hath famous Appendices both above and beneath, joyned to its Proceſſes; the ſuperior <hi>Appendix</hi> joyned to its Proceſs is large, and makes the globous head of the Thigh, having a ſtrong Neck which paſſeth into the Cavity of the <hi>Os Iſchium, Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and <hi>Pubis</hi> (which ſome call the <hi>Funnel,</hi> others the <hi>Box:</hi>) It is kept in this Cavity with ſtout Ligaments, one is broad and Membranous, which compaſſeth about the whol joynt, the other is round which is produced from the Cavity its ſelf, and preſently received in the Head: under the neck of the Thigh are two Proceſſes beheld, and they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by their Apendices, of which, the external is called <hi>Trochanter</hi> or <hi>Rotator major,</hi> conſpicuous with its Cavity and properlines; the other or internal which deſigns the figure of the blunt knob, is called <hi>Trochanter</hi> or <hi>Rotator minor.</hi> Each of them hath a ſtrong and ſafe inſertion, a ſtable beginning and ſtrong Muſcles. The inferior Appendix of the Thigh waxing thick by degrees with his proceſs is placed in the Cavities of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> with a double Protuberance like two large Heads; the Cavity as it is light before, ſo behind it is very notable, by which large veſſels with the great Nerve of the fourth pair, is carried to the Legs: behind, Nature hath placed two Bones called <hi>Seſamoides</hi> to the inferior Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Thigh, which defend the beginnings of the Muſcle called <hi>Gaſterocnemius</hi> in its motion.</p>
               <p>Before in the Joynt of the Thigh with the <hi>Tibia</hi> is the <hi>Mola,</hi> which alſo is called <hi>Patella,</hi> a ſhort round Bone, ſticking to the Tendons of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which extend the Leg, from a Cartilaginous ſubſtance it grows to the ſollidity of a Bone by degrees: It is plain without, gibbous within and covered with a Cartilaginous cruſt; its nexure is looſe that ſo it may avoid luxation the better, and yet it is no help at all to the motion of the Muſcles.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40322:83"/>
               <p>The Leg like the Cubit is compoſed of two Bones, much differing both in thickneſs and ſtrength; they are disjoyned in the middle, and have a ſtrong Ligament between, and give ſecurity to the Muſcles that move the Feet.</p>
               <p>The firſt and chiefeſt of theſe is called <hi>Tibia:</hi> It is large, ſtrong, and by reaſon of the variety of its ſides almoſt triangular, of which, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt towards the internal ſide is altogether deſtitute of fleſh, and makes an acute angle or Spine. It hath Appendices different in magnitude, of which, the ſuperior is famous in largeneſs, diducted behind into two heads, on the top with long Cavities it receives the hollow inferior Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the Thigh: in the middle between the knobs ariſeth a ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes the articulation ſtrong, &amp; this is helped both by that Membranous Ligament which is wrapped about the whol Joynt, and by other particular ones, both before and on the ſides. The inferior Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the <hi>Tibia</hi> is leſs, and yet it hath a notable Proceſs ſticking out on the internal ſide of the Foot, which is called the internal Ancle: It hath alſo diverſe Cavities, one lateral, to which the <hi>Fibula</hi> paſſeth, and two others diſtinguiſhed by a light Protuberance which is under the Ancle: as it is above committed to the Thigh, ſo it is below committed to the Ancle by <hi>Gynglymos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Bone of the Leg is called <hi>Fibula,</hi> and it is equal in length to the <hi>Tibia,</hi> but it is ſmaller and weaker by ods, from a thick back grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thin by degrees: It makes a light Cavity above by its round <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> to which the external bounch of the <hi>Tibia</hi> is joyned, and it ſends a manifeſt Proceſs to the outſide of the Foot, which is called the external Ancle-bone, and defends the <hi>Nexus</hi> of the <hi>Talus</hi> with the <hi>Tibia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the Bones of the extremity of the Foot, which like thoſe of the Hands, are divided into three parts, <hi>Tarſus, Metatarſus,</hi> and the Toes: The Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> are ſeven, which differ mightily both in bigneſs and figure.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is called <hi>Talus,</hi> or <hi>Aſtragalus,</hi> and conduceth more to the motion of the Foot than the reſt: It hath a large head and lightly ſinuous, that it may be the better fitted to the <hi>Tibia,</hi> comprehended on both ſides by the Ancles, it is joyned to the Ancles and the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> by various and ſtrong Ligaments before by a prominence with the Bone called <hi>Cymbiformis;</hi> underneath partly it ſticks out and partly hath Cavities, and is joyned to the <hi>Calcaneus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Calcaneus, Calx,</hi> or Heel-bone is the ſecond Bone of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the reſt both in bigneſs and ſtrength, it is long and ſtretched out toward the hinder part, that a man might ſtand the firmer and not eaſily fall backwards, it is unequal with knobs, for the more firm nexure of the Tendons of the Muſcles extending the Feet. It hath Cavities on the ſides that it might give deſcent to the Tendons, eſpecially on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by which both Tendons and Veſſels are carried to the Feet: into the <hi>Calcaneum</hi> are Ligaments tranſverſly inſerted from each Ancle, under which the Tendons of the Muſcles paſs ſafely to move the Toes, as it is joyned to the Bone called <hi>Cymbiformis</hi> before, ſo above it is joyned by ſtrong Ligaments to the <hi>Talus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40322:83"/>
               <p>The Third Bone of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> is called <hi>Cymbiformis,</hi> or <hi>Naviculare,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is carried as it were from the broader hinder part of the Hip to the Narrower fore part, by a crooked paſſage; here by a Cavity it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Talus,</hi> and is again received by the Wedg-like Bones.</p>
               <p>Three Bones make up the reſt of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> to which the Ancients gave no names. <hi>Fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pius</hi> calls them <hi>Sphenoidea,</hi> or Wedglike; of theſe, the firſt exceeds the third, and the third the ſecond in magnitude</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Foot is called <hi>Metatarſus,</hi> and conſiſts of five Bones, unequal both in length and thickneſs, yet are they ſtrong and disjoyned in the midſt and give ſafety to the Muſcles; they are thicker where they are joyned to the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> ſlenderer afterwards; at laſt being encreaſed by Proceſſes, they receive the heads of the Toes in their Cavities.</p>
               <p>The Bones of the Toes are fourteen, of which, thoſe two of the great Toe are bigger and ſtronger than the reſt; the other Toes have three apiece, much about the bigneſs of the Bones of the Fingers.</p>
               <p>The Bones called <hi>Seſamoida,</hi> remain yet to be ſpoken to, ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in bigneſs and compreſſed roundneſs they are like the ſeeds <hi>Seſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> From their firſt original they are Cartilaginous, and grow ſollid by age: Their bigneſs is various by reaſon of the Bones they ſtick to. They uſually account twelve of them to be in the Fingers, and as many in the Toes, but uſually there is fewer. They ſtick to the Joynts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fingers faſtened to the Ligaments, and defend not only the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, but alſo the Joynts.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that in the following Table you have an elegant <hi>Sceleton,</hi> or the joynings of the Bones of the whol Body, it were well worth the while to ſhew their nexures in a few words. The nexure of the Bones regards either Reſt or Motion; ſuch as regard Reſt, are called <hi>Symphyſis;</hi> and this is done either immediately, or by means of another Body.</p>
               <p>That which is performed immediately is done three waies; of which, the firſt is <hi>Rhaphe,</hi> or <hi>Sutura,</hi> when they are ſo joyned as though they were ſewed together as the Bones of the Skull. The ſecond is <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or a connexure by a line as in moſt of the Bones of the upper Jaw. The third is <hi>Gomphoſis,</hi> and is as when a Nail is ſtuck in a board, and ſo the Teeth are faſtened in their Cavities.</p>
               <p>Alſo the union that is made by means of another Body is done three waies. The firſt is called <hi>Synchondroſis,</hi> which is performed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening of Cartilages; and ſuch are the Bones of the <hi>Sternum, Pubis,</hi> and many others. The ſecond is <hi>Synneuroſis,</hi> which is done by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of Nervous parts and Ligaments, whether they be round or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Membranes. The third is called <hi>Syſſarcoſis,</hi> which is a nexure by Fleſh, as the Muſcles about the Shoulder and Thigh, and the Gums about the Teeth.</p>
               <p>The connexure which regards the motion of the Bones is called <hi>Arthron,</hi> or Articulation, and is divided into <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> or Dearticulation, and <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> or Coarticulation. <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> is a connexure of Bones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for evident, ſtrong, and eaſie motion, as in the Arms, Hands,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40322:84"/> Thighs and Feet. <hi>Synarthroſis</hi> is a connexure of Bones, in which moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more obſcure, weak, and difficult: both of theſe kinds of Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations conſiſts in three Manners.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is called <hi>Enarthroſis,</hi> namely when the Cavity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is deep, and the head received into it long, and this is ſeen in the Thigh with the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and in the <hi>Aſtragalus,</hi> with the Bone called <hi>Cymbiforme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is called <hi>Arthrodia</hi> in which the Cavity is light and the head committed to it ſhort and depreſſed; ſuch is between the hinder part of the head and the firſt Joynt of the Neck, between the inferior Jaw and the Bone of the Temples, the Ribs with the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and the Cartilages of the Ribs with the <hi>Sternum,</hi> the Bones of the <hi>Carpus</hi> with the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> and the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> with the <hi>Metatarſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is called <hi>Gynglimus,</hi> in which, Bones are ſo joyned that the head of one paſſeth into the Cavity of another, and in like manner his head into his Cavity, and ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thought the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the hinder part, ſo the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> is joyned with the Shoulder, and the Thigh with the <hi>Tibia,</hi> the <hi>Tibia</hi> with the <hi>Aſtragalus,</hi> and the <hi>Aſtraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> with the <hi>Calcaneus.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 18.</hi> Of the Muſcles of the Hands.</head>
               <p>THE Hands, ſeeing they are the famous Instruments of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Works, cannot want both various and ſtrong Muſcles; the greateſt part of which, together with thoſe that are referred to the Feet, better deſerve the names of Muſcles than thoſe which we have hitherto ſhewed about the Breaſt, Abdomen, Back, and Head;
<pb facs="tcp:40322:86"/>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:40322:86"/> therefore that they may not want their vulgar diſtinction wherein they are diſtinguiſhed into Head, Belly and Tail, being ſomething like <hi>Mice</hi> or <hi>Lizards</hi> if you take away their Feet: we muſt take the beginning of the Muſcle for the head, that part to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the contraction is made for the tail, the end of the Muſcle, or that thin and Nervous part by which it moves; for the belly, the middle part of the Muſcle, which is more ſwelled by reaſon of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>The Tendines of theſe move admiration almoſt, being famous in ſtrength, and cleer in colour; and although we call it the tail of the Muſcle, yet is it properly a Spermatical part ſtretched along the length of the Muſcle, which being before ſcattered in <hi>Fibrae,</hi> is now gathered together, and being endewed with Spirit by the Nerves, moves the part it is inſerted into by contracting it.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles of the Hand, pertain, ſome to the Shoulder, ſome to the Cubit, and ſome to the Hand it ſelf. The Muſcles called <hi>Deltoides,</hi> lift up the Shoulder, called ſo from its form, being large and fleſhy; it ariſeth from a broad beginning from the middle <hi>Clavicula,</hi> the top of the Shoulder or <hi>Acromium,</hi> and it is faſtened into the midſt of the Shoulder with a ſtrong Tendon: Alſo the Muſcle which proceeds from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>Scapula</hi> called <hi>Coracois,</hi> helps to perform this office. It hath a long fleſhy body, and is inſerted about the middle of the inner part of the Shoulder. The Pectoral Muſcle which we ſpake of in his proper place, draws the Shoulder to the Breaſt, and the broadeſt of the Back draws it back again, of both which we ſpake in the twelfth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Muſcle called <hi>Rotundus major</hi> depreſſeth the Shoulder; it is of a fleſhy thick body: It ariſeth from the inferior angle of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and is inſerted into the Shoulder neer the Tendon of the Pectoral Muſcle. Alſo the Muſcle called <hi>Rotundus minor</hi> depreſſeth the Shoulder, and if you heed their nexure, it is but a certain portion of the former: it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the inferior angle of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and from a round belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſlenderer, and ends in the Neck of the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Three Muſcles ſeem to compaſs the Shoulder about; of which, two are placed above the <hi>Scapula,</hi> three beneath it: the firſt of the Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapulars, ariſing from the Baſis of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> above the Proceſs called <hi>Spiniformis,</hi> is carried foreward with a ſtrong Tendon and knit to the fift Ligament of the Shoulder. The ſecond ariſing from the Baſis of the <hi>Scapula</hi> under the <hi>Spina,</hi> being fleſhy and thick ends with a ſhort and broad Tendon in that Ligament of the Shoulder which is called the fourth. The <hi>Infraſcapularis</hi> is carried from the inferior ſide of the Baſis of the <hi>Scapulae,</hi> being fleſhy and broad and ends in the third Ligament of the Shoulder,</p>
               <p>The Cubit is bowed by two Muſcles placed before; of which, the firſt is called <hi>Biceps</hi> from his double beginning; from its figure it is called, a Fiſh: it ariſeth partly from the Funnel of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> partly from the Proceſs <hi>Coracois,</hi> and deſcends into the ſuperior head of the <hi>Radius,</hi> with a round but ſtrong Tendon. The other of the bowing Muſcles is called <hi>Brachiaeus;</hi> this lies under the former: it takes its beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Shoulder, and being dilated downwards with a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40322:87"/> fleſhy end, it concludes as well in the Ligament of the Joynt, as in the Appendix of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and <hi>Radius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cubit is extended by two other Muſcles called <hi>Poſtici,</hi> of which, the firſt and longer is compoſed of a double beginning; one high about the Neck of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> the other low under the head of the Shoulder; under the Tendon of the broadeſt Muſcle of the Back; it is broad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ends outwardly in the top of the Cubit: The ſecond extender is ſhorter and ariſeth about the middle of the Shoulder, and being joyned to the former it ends outwardly on the top of the Cubit. To theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders the Muſcle called <hi>Anconeus</hi> is joyned, being of a very ſmal body, ariſing behind from the inferior part of the Shoulder, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends a little obliquely into the ſide of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> between the two Bones of the Cubit.</p>
               <p>To move the <hi>Radius</hi> are four Muſcles produced, of which, two which are commonly called <hi>Pronatores,</hi> turn the <hi>Radius</hi> inwards; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two are called <hi>Supinatores,</hi> and move it outwards. The firſt of the <hi>Pronati</hi> is ſquare in form, riſing tranſverſly from the internal ſide of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and is committed to the internal part of the <hi>Radius.</hi> The ſecond is called <hi>Teres</hi> from its round body produced from the internal bunch of the Shoulder, and paſſeth obliquely almoſt to the middle of the <hi>Radius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of the <hi>Supinati</hi> which is the longer, takes its beginning high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above the external bunch of the Shoulder, and ſending down a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Tendon paſſeth to the inferior Appendix of the <hi>Radius:</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſhorter and thin, ariſing below about the Ligament of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ends neer the middle of the <hi>Radius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Four Muſcles are aſſigned to the Wreſt, although three of them come even to the <hi>Metacarpus:</hi> two of theſe are bowers and as many extenders of the bowers of the Wreſt by reaſon of their difference of Scituation: the one is called internal, the other external; both of them ariſe from the internal knob of the Shoulder: The internal paſſeth to the fourth Bone of the Wreſt, the external to the Bone of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the fore-finger.</p>
               <p>The internal of the extending Muſcles, deſcending from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knob of the Shoulder, is carried to the bone of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> which is ſubject to the little finger. The external Extending Muſcle, ariſing above the external bunch of the Shoulder, is faſtned often times with a double Tendon, into the firſt and ſecond Bone of the <hi>Metacarpus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the palm of the Hand is referred the Muſcle called <hi>Palmarius,</hi> by means of which the wrinkling of the ſkin is the better performed. It takes its beginnig from the internal bunch of the Shoulder, and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out a Membranous Tendon by the Palm of the Hand, even to the confines of the Fingers, the fleſhy Membrane again unfolds the ſkin being wrinkled by this Muſcle.</p>
               <p>The Fingers of the Hand requires various motion and ſtrength, and therefore various Muſcles with ſtrong Tendons, bow them, extend them, and turn them to the ſides. Of the bowing Muſcles, ſome are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to more Fingers than one, ſome only to the Thumb: Thoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40322:87"/> that are ſubſervient to more, are thoſe that are dedicated to the motion of the firſt, ſecond, and third <hi>Internodii,</hi> of the four Fingers, (I do not know what Engliſh word to give <hi>Internodium,</hi> it ſignifies the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Joynt and another) that which bows the ſecond <hi>Internodium</hi> takes its beginning from the internal knob of the Shoulder, and toward the end is divided into four Tendons, which paſs into the ſecond Bones of the Fingers: The Muſcle bowing the third <hi>Internodium,</hi> takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the internal bunch of the Shoulder, and the foremoſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and with four ſtrong Tendons proceeds to the third Bones of the Fingers. The bowers of the firſt <hi>Internodium</hi> of the Fingers, by reaſon of its thin and round Body is called <hi>Lumbricalis,</hi> and ariſeth from the Membranes of the Tendons of the foregoing Muſcle, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally inſerted in the firſt bone of the Fingers.</p>
               <p>The Thumb becauſe it hath a ſingular ſtrength above the reſt of the Fingers, hath diverſe bowers: Two Muſcles bow its firſt <hi>Internodium,</hi> which take their beginning from the annular Ligament of the Wreſt and the Bone ſubject to the Thumb, and end in the firſt Bone of the Thumb: Three or four bowers move the ſecond <hi>Internodium</hi> which are but ſhort, yet fleſhy; they ariſe from the bones of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> which ſuſtain the fore, middle, and Ring-finger, and end in the ſecond Bone of the Thumb: The bower of the third bone is but one, but that one is very ſtrong; this takes its beginning from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> where it receives the head of the <hi>Radius,</hi> paſſeth to the third <hi>Internodium</hi> of the Thumb with a ſtrong Tendon; and theſe are the Muſcles which bow the Hands.</p>
               <p>The ſtretchers out of the ſecond and third <hi>Internodii</hi> of the Fingers, are held to be two, though indeed they ſeem to be but one Muſcle, for both of them riſe from the external bunch of the Shoulder, and are exquiſitly joyned in their progreſs, their tendons being united, and knit to the ſecond and third Bones of the Fingers, having neither difference in body nor office. The interoſſeal Muſcles extend the firſt <hi>Internodium</hi> of the Fingers, of which more by and by.</p>
               <p>The Thumb as it hath two bowers, ſo hath it two ſingular extenders, one of which riſing from the exterior ſide of the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> aſcends even to the third <hi>Internodium</hi> of the Thumb; the other coming from the like beginning, paſſeth by a ſuperior portion to a bone of the Wreſt under the Thumb, by an inferior portion to the firſt and ſecond <hi>Internodium</hi> of the Thumb, and alſo further.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe motions the Fingers are disjoyned, and then again joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſix Muſcles perform this office, of which, Authors call the three external Interoſſeal, being placed between the Bones of the <hi>Metacarpus;</hi> theſe riſing up between the ſides of the Fingers internally and externally, ſtretch their Tendons even to the firſt, ſecond, and third <hi>internodium,</hi> to which two Muſcles of a like office come, and are as auxiliaries to them, from the firſt and laſt bone of the <hi>Metacarpus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fore Finger hath ſingular <hi>Abductors,</hi> and ſo hath the little Finger. The <hi>Abductor</hi> of the fore Finger is more rightly called <hi>Indicator:</hi> It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the middle of the Cubit, and paſſeth frequently with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40322:88"/> body and Tendon, to the firſt <hi>Internodium</hi> both of the fore and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Finger, and yet ſometimes it terminates in the bone of the <hi>Metacar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> which regards the fore Finger. The <hi>Abductor</hi> of the little Finger proceeding from the fourth bone of the Wreſt paſſing by the Palm of the Hand, is externally inſerted into the firſt <hi>Internodium.</hi> The Thumb hath its proper <hi>Adductor</hi> and <hi>Abductor,</hi> received in its firſt <hi>Internodium:</hi> the <hi>Abductor</hi> takes its original from the little bone of the Wreſt joyned to the Thumb; the other from the bone of the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> which ſuſtains the fore Finger; yet here by reaſon of its firm nexure by its Tendinous Body, to the firſt bone of the fore Finger it ſeems to draw the fore Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Thumb.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 19.</hi> Of the Muſcles of the Foot.</head>
               <p>FOR the readineſs of going, the Foot is aided with various Muſcles; part of which, fit the Thigh and Leg, and part, the Foot it ſelf with various motions. The Muſcles which bow the Thigh are called <hi>Pſoas, Iliacus internus,</hi> alſo the <hi>Triceps</hi> and <hi>Lividus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pſoas</hi> takes its beginning about the two inferior <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Breaſt, and the three ſuperior of the Loyns, and deſcends obliquely to the leſſer rotation of the Thigh, The internal Iliack ariſeth from the internal face of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and its Tendon being joyned with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it terminates with it. The Muſcle called <hi>Triceps</hi> is famous amongſt the reſt for its bigneſs, it ariſeth from the <hi>Coxendix</hi> and <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> with a three-fold beginning, and is inſerted below into the rough line of the Thigh. The <hi>Lividus</hi> is produced from the commiſſure of the Bones of the <hi>Pubis,</hi> and inſerted into the internal ſide of the Thigh by a ſhort Tendon.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40322:90"/>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:40322:90"/>
               <p>Three Muſcles extend the Thigh which are called <hi>Glutaei,</hi> and alſo prepared by the providence of the Almighty for the better accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſitting, and the ſafeguard of the Joynt <hi>Iſchium:</hi> of theſe, that which is called <hi>Glutaeus major,</hi> being ſtretched from the brim of the <hi>Ilium, Os Sacrum,</hi> and <hi>Coccix,</hi> it ends under the great <hi>Rotator</hi> of the Thigh. <hi>Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus medius</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>Os Ilium</hi> under the former, and is faſtened with a ſtrong Tendon into the ſame <hi>Rotator:</hi> the leſſer <hi>Glutaeus</hi> ariſeth below from the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and deſcends to the ſuperior part of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Rotator.</hi> Theſe three, though ſhort, yet fleſhy and ſtrong Muſcles, as they extend the Thigh, ſo the Muſcle <hi>Triceps</hi> before mentioned, moves the Thigh inwards, whereby we climb the Maſts of Ships and Trees, and ſit firmly on a Horſe.</p>
               <p>There move the Thigh about the Muſcle called <hi>Pyriformis,</hi> otherwiſe called the external Iliack, the external and internal <hi>Obturator,</hi> to which a fourth is added. The <hi>Pyriformis</hi> riſing below from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> is tranſverſly inſerted behind with a round Tendon into the greater <hi>Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> The external <hi>Obturator</hi> ariſeth from the external compaſs of the hole, which is commonly accounted the original of the Bones of the <hi>Pubis,</hi> and paſſing tranſverſly is received in the Cavity of the great <hi>Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> The internal <hi>Obturator,</hi> ariſeth from the internal Circumference of the aforeſaid hole, and with a four-fold collection of Tendons, though with a ſingle fleſhy habit, it paſſeth to the place the former did; for its ſafeguard ſake it is ſent through a fleſhy ſubſtance like a purſe. A fourth is added to theſe, which ariſing from the external knob of the <hi>Os Ilium,</hi> and the Appendix of the <hi>Iſchium</hi> proceeds to the hinder part of the great <hi>Rotator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tibia</hi> is extended by four Muſcles, <hi>Membranoſus, Rectus, Vaſtus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus,</hi> and <hi>internus.</hi> The Membranous muſcle ariſing before from the brim of the <hi>Os ilium,</hi> with a ſmal and fleſhy body, afterwards compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Thigh about on every ſide with a broad and membranous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It is inſerted into the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> under the Knee. The right muſcle deſcending from the internal knob of the <hi>Os ilium,</hi> includes the Knee with a broad and ſtrong Tendon, and terminates in the <hi>Tibia. Vaſtus externus</hi> is ſo called from its bulk, it deſcends from the great <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> of the Thigh outwardly, and mixing its large Tendon with the former, it ends in the ſame place with it. <hi>Vaſtus internus</hi> takes its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the neck and leſſer <hi>Rotator</hi> of the Thigh, and is united to the two former by a membranous Tendon, and is knit internally under the Knee-pan. To theſe extenders of the <hi>Tibia</hi> they ad the muſcle called <hi>Crureus,</hi> which ſticks to the Thigh as the <hi>Brachiaeus</hi> doth to the Arm; its original is taken between the two <hi>Rotators</hi> of the Thigh, and it unites its Tendons with the Muſcles called <hi>Vaſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſculus Subpoplitius</hi> moves the <hi>Tibia</hi> obliquely, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Ligament of the Knee before, ends obliquely in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Appendix of the <hi>Tibia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There bow the <hi>Tibia</hi> the muſcles called <hi>Faſcialis,</hi> or <hi>Sartorius, Gracilis, Seminervoſus, Semimembranus</hi> and <hi>Biceps.</hi> The <hi>Faſcialis</hi> deſcends frOm the foremoſt Appendix of the <hi>Os ilium,</hi> with a long and oblique decurſion to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40322:91"/> the internal part of the Leg under the Knee. <hi>Gracilis</hi> ariſing neer the commiſſure of the Bones of the <hi>Pubis,</hi> ends under the former with a round Tendon. <hi>Seminervoſus</hi> deſcending from the <hi>Coxendix</hi> beneath, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing obliquely forwards by the poſterior part of the Thigh is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the internal part of the <hi>Tibia. Semimembranoſus</hi> ariſeth from the ſame beginning, and faſtens his Tendon in the internal part of the <hi>Tibia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. <hi>Biceps</hi> ariſeth with a longer portion where the two former do, but is much increaſed with a fleſhy portion in the midſt of the Thigh, and ends with a ſtrong Tendon in the top of the <hi>Fibula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Muſcles which particularly move the Feet are to be referred to the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> or Toes, or great Toe: The <hi>Tibialis anticus</hi> and <hi>Peroneus ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> bow the <hi>Tarſus.</hi> The <hi>Tibialis anticus</hi> ariſing from the ſuperior Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula,</hi> runs tranſverſly under the Ligament of the Foot, and ends in the bone of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> ſubject to the great Toe. <hi>Pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus ſecundus,</hi> is produced from the fleſhy riſe of the <hi>Fibula,</hi> and is inſerted externally, uſually with a double Tendon into the bone of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> ſubſervient to the little Toe.</p>
               <p>The Muſcle called <hi>Tibialis poſticus</hi> moves it obliquely downwards and inwards, and the <hi>Peroneus primus</hi> outwards. <hi>Tibialis poſticus</hi> ariſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula,</hi> is inſerted into the bone of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> which is committed to the <hi>Cubiforme,</hi> neer the internal Ancle. <hi>Peroneus primus</hi> is deduced from the Appendix of the <hi>Fibula</hi> about the external Ancle, and is turned back under the Ligament of the Foot, and faſtened in the bone of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> which is joyned to the great Toe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaſterocnemius</hi> and <hi>Muſculus ſoleus</hi> extend the <hi>Tarſus:</hi> both of them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Muſcles, not only by reaſon of the bulk of their bodies, but alſo by reaſon of the ſtrength of their actions, and they ſeem to make up that bulk which is called the Calf of the Leg. The <hi>Gaſterocnemius</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted double, becauſe it ariſeth from a double beginning, from the internal and external inferior head of the Thigh, it is inſerted into the Heel with a ſtrong Tendon, although it ſeem to be ſtretched out under the ſoal of the Foot even to the confines of the Toes. <hi>Soleus</hi> takes his denomination from the figure of a Fiſh ſo called; it ariſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind from the <hi>Fibula,</hi> and its Tendon is inſerted with the former; here by reaſon of its thickneſs and ſtrength, this Tendon above all the reſt in the body is called the <hi>Great Chord:</hi> before, it is inſerted into the Heel, it is ſevered a little from the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and being grievouſly either wounded or bruiſed, it brings pernicious Symptoms. Between theſe extenders is the Muſcle called <hi>Plantaris,</hi> which ariſing with a ſmall body from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior external head of the Thigh, ſends a long and ſlender Tendon to the Heel.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles which move the Toes, extend, bend, and oblique their Bones; the extender of the third <hi>internodium</hi> is dilated from the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Appendix of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> under the tranſverſe Ligament of the Foot, and admitted with four Tendons into the top bone of each Toe. The extendor of the ſecond <hi>internodium</hi> comes from the Ligament on the back of the foot, and paſſeth with four Tendons to the four ſecond bones.

               <p>The Muſcles called <hi>Perforans, Perforatus,</hi> and <hi>Lumbricales,</hi> bow the Toes. <hi>Perforans</hi> which they alſo call <hi>Sublimis,</hi> takes its beginning behind from the <hi>Tibia,</hi> about the internal Ancle, paſſing under the Ligament of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and Heel; in the ſoal of the Foot being divided into a four-fold Tendon it paſſeth into the extream <hi>internodium</hi> of the Toes. <hi>Perforatus</hi> is by ſome called <hi>Profundus,</hi> it proceeds beneath from the Heel, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out four Tendons, which are divided toward the end for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Tendons of the foregoing muſcle, they paſs to the ſecond <hi>internodium</hi> of the Toes. Nature frames the <hi>Lumbricals</hi> of the Tendons, of the two former Muſcles, as in the Hands, and in four Tendons they are faſtned to the firſt <hi>internodium</hi> of the Toes; a portion of muſculous fleſh moves forward the bowing of theſe, which being ſtretched from the Heel, mixeth it ſelf with the beginnings of the Lumbrical muſcles. The proper bower of the great Toe proceeds behind from the <hi>Fibula,</hi> and follows the way of the Muſcle <hi>Perforans,</hi> and is inſerted by a ſtrong Tendon into the third bone of the great Toe.</p>
               <p>The Interoſſeal muſcles moves the Toes obliquely, placed between the bones of the <hi>Metatarſus,</hi> of which, ſuch as are external paſs to the firſt <hi>internodium</hi> of the Toes; the internal paſs even to the ſecond Joynt: theſe muſcles alſo extend the firſt and ſecond bone of the Toes; the Toes are drawn together by the internal, drawn aſunder by the external.</p>
               <p>The great and little Toe have ſingular muſcles, the one hath one Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, and two Adductors; the other one Abductor. The <hi>Abductor</hi> of the great Toe takes his riſe from the Ligament of the Heel, and paſſeth to its firſt <hi>internodium.</hi> The greater <hi>Adductor</hi> ariſeth from the Ligament of the bone of the <hi>Metatarſus,</hi> which is next to the little Toe, and by an oblique proceſs paſſeth to the firſt Joynt of the great Toe: The leſſer <hi>Adductor</hi> is tranſverſe in Scituation, and ariſeth from the Ligament of the little Toe, which binds the firſt <hi>internodium,</hi> and paſſeth with a ſhort and broad Tendon to the firſt bone of the great Toe. The <hi>Abductor</hi> of the little Toe is produced outwards from the Heel, and ends in the external ſide of the firſt <hi>internodium.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 20.</hi> Of the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves of the Extream Parts.</head>
               <p>LEſt the Extream parts ſhould be wearied with continual labor, they have nouriſhment and vital vigor adminiſtred to them by the Veins and Arteries, and Spirit which is the Author of voluntary motion by the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Veins which are diſtributed to the Hand take their original from the common Branch, for the ſubclavian Vein paſſing out of the Cavity of the Breaſt, changeth its name into <hi>Axillaris,</hi> and having firſt ſent out the external and internal Scapular Vein, it is divided into two famous Branches, the one external, the other internal, of which, the one makes the Cephalick or Humeral Vein, the other the Baſilick or Liver Vein.</p>
               <p>The Cephalick Vein deſcending from the upper part of the axillar by the Shoulder, neer the external ſide of the Muſcle that bows the Cubit, gives certain ſmall Branches to the ſkin and muſcles, and being dilated to the external knob of the Cubit, it is commonly diſtributed into three Branches; of which, the firſt which is the ſmalleſt is ſent to the Muſcles which bow the Fingers, and the long <hi>Supinator,</hi> and therefore is called the deep Branch of the <hi>Cephallica.</hi> The ſecond branch which is internal and larger, is obliquely carried under the Joynt of the Cubit, and being united to the internal Branch of the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> makes that Vein which is uſually called the median or common Vein; this alſo deſcending, after it hath diſtributed certain branches to the <hi>Radius,</hi> is divided into two ſmall Branches, of which, that which goes to the Thumb, is called the Cephallical Vein of the Hand, the other hath no name and paſſeth to the fore and middle Fingers: The third Cephalical Branch and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, paſſeth obliquely by the <hi>Radius</hi> to the external or hinder part of the Cubit, where being joyned to a ſmal Branch of the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> it gives branches to the annular and little Finger, of which, that which paſſeth to the little Finger is called the <hi>Salvatella</hi> of the Hand.</p>
               <p>The Baſilical branch of the axillar Vein, after it hath brought forth the ſuperior and inferior Breaſt-vein, it enters the Arm, and brings forth the Liver-vein in the right Arm, and the Spleen-vein in the left Arm, or if you will the left <hi>Baſilica,</hi> this giving Branches to the axillar <hi>Glandulae,</hi> it is divided into two Branches, of which, the deepeſt aſſociating it ſelf with the Artery and the Nerve of the third and fourth pair paſſing the Joynt of the Cubit, it is again diſtributed into two branches, one exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40322:94"/> from which the Thumb, fore, and middle Finger, the other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from which the Ring and little Finger have Veins. The other Branch of the <hi>Baſilica</hi> is called <hi>Subcutaneus,</hi> deſcending to the Cubit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth its double Vein, the one internal which in the bowing of the Elbow ſending out a Vein which joyns it ſelf to the next deſcending ones, is afterwards joyned to the Cephalical Branch and makes the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> the other external, which divides its ſelf, and by its greater branch paſſeth to the Wreſt and little Finger, and by its leſſer to the internal part of the Hand.</p>
               <p>All the Arteries of the Hands proceed from the Axillar branch of the ſubclavian Artery which is joyned to the internal ſide of the Shoulder, to the internal branch of the <hi>Baſilica</hi> after it hath ſent out the ſcapular and Breaſt Arteries, and to the Muſcles which occupy the internal, ſide of the Shoulder, and two branches to the Joynt, under the bowing of the Elbow it is divided into two large Arteries, of which, the external is carried to the Wreſt neer the <hi>Radius,</hi> where its motion is felt by Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and having diſtributed a ſmall branch to the hinder part of the Hand, being carried under the annular Ligament it is diſtributed to the Thumb, Fore and middle Finger; the internal branch deſcending neer the Cubit is deeper and ſends branches to the middle, ring, and little Finger.</p>
               <p>The Nerves of the Hands take their beginnings from the fift, ſixt, and ſeventh pairs of the Neck, alſo from the firſt and ſecond of the Breaſt; they are firſt joyned by a various nexure, before they paſs to the extream parts: they are vulgarly accounted ſix pair.</p>
               <p>The firſt pair is carried to the Muſcle <hi>Deltois,</hi> and the ſkin of the Arm.</p>
               <p>The ſecond pair is thicker and being carried by the midſt of the Arm before, is inſerted into the muſcle <hi>Biceps</hi> with two branches, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in its progreſs gives a branch to the external <hi>Supinator</hi> of the Wreſt: the reſt being produced by the bowing of the Elbow, is divided into two Branches, the external of which joyns its ſelf a companion to the Cephalick Vein, and paſſeth to the ſecond <hi>internodium</hi> of the Thumb, and the internal which is thicker and divided under the Median Vein, and extends its external branch to the Wreſt, and its internal being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated neer the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> ſends out ſmall Nerves on both ſides to the Palm of the Hand.</p>
               <p>The third pair being joyned neer the ſecond, having firſt ſent a ſmal branch under the ſkin, after it toucheth the Arm, ſends out branches to the ſecond bower of the Cubit, to the Muſcles bowing the third <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodium</hi> of the Fingers, and branches to the Thumb, fore, and middle Finger.</p>
               <p>The fourth pair is larger and thicker than the reſt, and at its riſe is neer the <hi>Baſilica</hi> Vein, the Artery and the third pair of Nerves, and firſt beſtows a double Branch upon the Muſcles that extend the Arm, and the ſkin; about the joynt of the Elbow it ſends two Branches to the Wreſt, alſo Branches to the external and internal ſide of the Thumb, fore, and middle Finger, three Branches to the muſcles, extending the Wreſt and

               <p>The fift pair of Nerves is neer the former, and ſends Branches to the Muſcles ariſing from the internal knob of the Shoulder; it produceth two Branches, of which, one paſſing to the Palm of the Hand, is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the little, ring, and middle Finger: the other runs to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of thoſe Fingers.</p>
               <p>The ſixt pair, which is the laſt of the Nerves of the Neck, is almoſt altogether ſubcutaneous; it hath diverſe branches, moſt of which, ſome paſs under, ſome above the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> which being pricked in letting blood, cauſe acute pain, and convulſions; the remainder of it ends in the Wreſt. Note this, That neither the Veins, Arteries, nor Nerves, have the ſame bigneſs in all Bodies, nor yet the ſame number nor paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: obſerve the like in the Foot.</p>
               <p>We come now to the Veins of the Foot, which take their original from the the Iliack Branch of the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Saphena,</hi> produced by a long product, by the internal ſide of the Thigh and Leg, ſending branches from the beginning and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle to the Thigh and Knee; it is at laſt divided into many Branches about the Thigh and Ancle, to the Toes, eſpecially the great Toe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond crural Vein is called <hi>Iſchias,</hi> proceeding externally from the ſame Root; this is ſhorter and runs tranſverſly to the ſkin before, and the muſcles of the <hi>Coxendix,</hi> which are next to it.</p>
               <p>The third is called <hi>Muſcula,</hi> produced from the crural Branch deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Muſcles, to which it gives a double branch, internally and externally, nay, ſometimes 'tis double in its beginning; the one exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal which is leaſt, and paſſeth to the Muſcles <hi>Rectus,</hi> and <hi>Vaſtus externus,</hi> which extend the Leg; the other bigger and internal, which gives very many branches to the Muſcles of the Thigh.</p>
               <p>The fourth crural Vein is called <hi>Poplitea,</hi> ariſing from the ſame begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but moſt commonly hath two Branches uniting themſelves in their progreſs; it deſcends by the middle of the Ham, and diſtributing Branches above and below the Calf of the Leg, is carried to the Heel, and ends in the ſkin of the external Ancle.</p>
               <p>But the Crural Branch having produced theſe Branches, deſcends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two heads of the Thigh, and produceth a double Branch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external: The internal gives Branches to the Muſcles, which conſtitute the Calf of the Leg, and giving Branches to the ſkin it turns back under the internal Ancle, and paſſeth even to the great Toe. The external is leſs than the former, and hath two Branches, of which, the firſt paſſeth to the Muſcles of the Calf of the Leg, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oſe that bow the Toes: about the middle of the <hi>Tibia</hi> it ſends a ſmall branch to the great Toe, the fore, and middle Toe, and paſſing the tranſverſe Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment outwardly, it gives Branches to the Muſcles of the Foot which bow the Toes; the other Branch after it hath diſperſed Branches to the external and hinder region of the Leg, it ends in the external Ancle and Foot. The Trunk of the Crural Vein joyns its ſelf as a companion to the Crural Artery, and ſends out branches to the right and left ſide.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:40322:95"/>
               <p>Nature hath often framed ſhutters in the Veins both of the Arms and Legs, which reſtrain the inordinate flux of blood to the extream parts.</p>
               <p>All the Arteries of the Foot, ariſe from the Branch of the Crural Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for the external Iliack branch paſſing out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, ſends a branch to the internal Iliack Muſcle, and paſſing without the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is called <hi>Cruralis;</hi> internally it produceth the Artery <hi>Iſchias,</hi> and the external <hi>Muſcula,</hi> which is carried to the external Muſcles of the Thigh, and the internal <hi>Muſcula</hi> which paſſeth to the poſterior and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Muſcles thereof.</p>
               <p>The Branch of the Crural Artery is divided into very many Branches above the Ham, of which, three or four ſmall ones paſs to the Fat, and the Membrane under it. Of theſe, that called <hi>Poplitea</hi> is moſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, which ariſeth about the middle of the Thigh, and is diſtributed partly to its inferior Muſcles, and partly to thoſe of the Calf of the Leg.</p>
               <p>The Crural Branch deſcending about the Ham, gives another Artery, called <hi>Suralis,</hi> which ſometimes is double, and paſſeth partly to the Joynt, and partly to the Muſcle of the Calf of the Leg called <hi>Gaſteroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemius.</hi> In the Ham it ſelf the Artery is divided into the external Branch, which paſſeth to the foremoſt Muſcles of the Leg, and into two hinder Branches, of which, one paſſeth to the Muſcles of the Calf, the other paſſing the tranſverſe Ligament of the Foot, is inſerted into the Muſcles adducing the Toes.</p>
               <p>The common branch deſcending by the hinder part of the Leg, having firſt ſent out a ſmall Branch which is diſtributed to the great Toe and the back of the Foot, is at length covered with the Tendons of the Toes, and being divided into a double Branch, paſſeth to all the Toes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Nerves of the Foot proceed from the three inferior of the Loyns, and the four Superior pair of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and having firſt made a plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, they are afterwards divided into four Branches, of which, the firſt and third are ſhorter, &amp; not carried beyond the longitude of the Thigh: the ſecond comes to the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the fourth even to the Nails of the Feet.</p>
               <p>The firſt Branch of the Nerves ariſeth from the upper part of the plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, deſcends to the internal <hi>Rotator</hi> of the Thigh, and ſends Branches to the <hi>Faſcialis, Rectus,</hi> and <hi>Vaſtus externus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond deſcends by the Groyn with the Vein and Artery, and down to the Feet with the Vein <hi>Saphena,</hi> although in this long paſſage, it give Branches as to other places, to eſpecially to the Knee, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of it ends in the Muſcles of the Thigh and Knee.</p>
               <p>The third branch which is ſent from the plexure, paſſing through the hole of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> gives branches to the external <hi>Obturators,</hi> and the Muſcles which erect the Yard; the remainder of it is diſtributed to the ſkin of the Thigh, and the firſt and third Muſcles which bow the Leg.</p>
               <p>The fourth is made up of the four pairs which proceed from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and ſecond to none in length, thickneſs, and drineſs: this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the lower part of the Thigh ſends a branch backwards to the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40322:96"/> Buttocks and ſkin of the Thigh? and three others to the head of the <hi>Muſculus Seminervoſus, Semimembranoſus</hi> and <hi>Biceps</hi> which bow the Leg, and to the Muſcle <hi>Triceps,</hi> the trunk it ſelf, ſome ſmall Branches being ſent to the Thigh, to the firſt Extendor of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and to the Muſcle <hi>Plantaris,</hi> is divided into two branches in the Cavity of the Knee, of which, the one is external, the other internal; the external paſſeth to the <hi>Fibula,</hi> the external Ancle, and the ſkin by diverſe Branches, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Ligament of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula,</hi> paſſing under the tranſverſe Ligament, it paſſeth to the extenders of the Toes, and the Toes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the internal Branch paſſeth by the back-ſide of the Leg, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between the Muſcles or the Calf, is diſtributed under the Ligament by the longitude of the Foot, and ſends a double Nerve to each Toe.</p>
               <p>Nature is often various in the diſtinction of theſe Nerves, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies obſerves its ſcope: Sometimes this Nerve of the fourth pair is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided higher above the middle of the Thigh, into the internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Branch; ſometimes it keeps whol even to the middle of the Leg, and ſends out internal and external Branches to the Thigh and Leg.</p>
               <p>The cloſures of the extream parts are the Nails, which are of a middle ſubſtance between Bones and Cartilages; to the Roots of which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried both Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, from which they have life, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and vigor of ſence; they equal the bigneſs of the Fingers with a decent form, and are a little bowed; they are firmly joyned to the ſkin, and in the Hands they ſerve for apprehenſion, and handling of ſmall things; in the Feet, for ſecurity and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And thus thou haſt the ſcope of Nature in the forming of Man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the Name and Power of the moſt Wiſe CREATOR is held out, that ſo thou maieſt cry out with <hi>Panacres,</hi>
